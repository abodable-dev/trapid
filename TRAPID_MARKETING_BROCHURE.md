## The Construction Chaos Is Costing You

**Every day, builders across Australia face the same frustrating problems:**

❌ **Profit Leakage** - You thought you'd make $40K. You made $12K. What happened?

❌ **Missing Materials** - Job starts Monday. You're short 50 studs. Nobody noticed until now.

❌ **Spreadsheet Hell** - Estimates in Excel. Quotes in email. POs in another spreadsheet. Good luck finding anything.

❌ **Supplier Overcharges** - They quoted $2,800. They billed $3,400. You didn't catch it until too late.

❌ **Schedule Disasters** - One task delayed. Entire project shifts. You're manually updating 50+ tasks.

❌ **Compliance Nightmares** - Safety inspector asks for incident reports. You're digging through filing cabinets.

❌ **Team Confusion** - Your estimator doesn't know what your supervisor knows. Your accountant is three weeks behind.
