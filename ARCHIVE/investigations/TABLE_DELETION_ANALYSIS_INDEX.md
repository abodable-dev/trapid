## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Security & Data Integrity (Week 1)
**Effort**: 8-10 hours | **Priority**: P0 CRITICAL

- [ ] Add authentication middleware
- [ ] Add authorization checks
- [ ] Add pessimistic locking with transactions
- [ ] Add FK constraint with ON DELETE RESTRICT

### Phase 2: Reliability & Error Handling (Week 2)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours | **Priority**: P1 HIGH

- [ ] Improve network error handling & retry
- [ ] Classify database errors by type
- [ ] Standardize API error response format
- [ ] Add request timeout

### Phase 3: Observability & Polish (Week 3)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours | **Priority**: P2 MEDIUM

- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Add loading states to UI
- [ ] Add monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite

**Total Effort**: 21-29 hours  
**Total Cost**: ~$3,150-4,350 (at $150/hr)

## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk Level: ⚠️ MODERATE RISK
**Not suitable for production deployment without P0 fixes**

```
Security:      🔴 CRITICAL (No authentication)
Data Loss:     🔴 CRITICAL (Race conditions)
Integrity:     🟠 HIGH (No constraints)
Reliability:   🟠 HIGH (Poor error handling)
UX:            🟡 MEDIUM (No loading states)
Observability: 🟡 MEDIUM (No audit logs)
```

### Likelihood of Issues

| Scenario | Probability | If Happens | Severity |
|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Unauthorized deletion | HIGH (anyone with URL) | Data loss | CRITICAL |
| Concurrent delete race | MEDIUM (depends on usage) | Data loss | CRITICAL |
| Network timeout confusion | MEDIUM (2-5% of requests) | User confusion | MEDIUM |
| Database lock timeout | LOW (<1% of requests) | Deletion fails | LOW |

---

## Testing Coverage

### Current Implementation
- Frontend validation checks: ✓ 3/5 scenarios
- Backend re-validation: ✓ 3/5 scenarios
- Transaction safety: ✗ 0/5 scenarios
- Authorization: ✗ 0/5 scenarios
- Error classification: ✓ 1/5 scenarios

### Needed Tests
- Unit tests: 9 scenarios needed
- Integration tests: 8 scenarios needed
- Performance tests: 4 scenarios needed
- Security tests: 3 scenarios needed

---

## Monitoring Checklist

Before production deployment, ensure:

- [ ] Delete success rate >95%
- [ ] Error rate <5%
- [ ] P99 deletion time <5 seconds
- [ ] Zero unauthorized deletions
- [ ] Zero data loss incidents
- [ ] Audit logs capturing all deletions

---

## Security Issues

### CVE-1: No Authentication (CRITICAL)
**CVSS Score**: 9.8 | **Attack Vector**: Network

```bash
# Any user can delete any table
curl -X DELETE http://api/v1/tables/123
```

**Fix**: Add `before_action :authenticate_user!`

### CVE-2: No Authorization (HIGH)
**CVSS Score**: 7.1 | **Attack Vector**: Network

Any authenticated user can delete any table.

**Fix**: Add `before_action :authorize_table_access!`

---

## Data Integrity Issues

### Issue 1: Race Condition - Table becomes live
**Window**: 50-100ms between frontend check and backend confirmation

**Attack**:
1. User A clicks delete (table is_live=false)
2. User B makes table live
3. User A's DELETE proceeds (backend check fails)

**Better scenario** (if no locking):
1. User A and B both delete same table concurrently
2. Both pass initial checks
3. Both attempt DROP TABLE
4. Table drops with inconsistent state

**Fix**: Use `Table.lock` and transaction

### Issue 2: Race Condition - Records added
**Window**: 50-100ms between record count check and DROP TABLE

**Attack**:
1. User A deletes table with 0 records
2. User B adds record
3. User A's DROP TABLE executes
4. Record orphaned, data lost

**Fix**: Move record count check into transaction

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Today)
- [ ] Document that feature is NOT production ready
- [ ] Add warning comment in code
- [ ] Don't expose delete UI to users
- [ ] Block API access to /api/v1/tables/DELETE

### This Week (Days 1-5)
- [ ] Implement P0 fixes (security + transactions)
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Security review by team lead

### Next Week (Days 6-10)
- [ ] Implement P1 fixes (error handling + retry)
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Load test with 100+ concurrent deletions

### Week 3 (Days 11-15)
- [ ] Implement P2 fixes (logging + monitoring)
- [ ] Full test suite
- [ ] Production readiness sign-off
