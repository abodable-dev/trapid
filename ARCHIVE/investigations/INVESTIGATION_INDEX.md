## Key Discoveries Summary

### System Architecture
```
Two distinct task systems:
1. ProjectTask - Detailed project planning with dependencies
2. ScheduleTask - Supplier delivery tracking

Each with independent Gantt visualization
Integrated with purchase orders and templates
Proper hierarchy: Construction → Project → Tasks
```

### What's Working
- Task creation/editing/deletion
- Status tracking (4 states)
- Task dependencies (4 types)
- Circular dependency prevention
- Critical path identification
- Gantt charts (3 zoom levels)
- Inline table editing
- Excel schedule import
- Purchase order integration

### What Needs Work
- Dynamic user fetching (currently hardcoded)
- User roles/permissions
- Backward pass algorithm
- Task comments/notifications
- Resource workload tracking
- Multi-project portfolio

- Float calculation not implemented
- No collaboration features
- Limited to single-project view

### Ready For Production
- Basic to intermediate project scheduling
- Task management with dependencies
- Gantt visualization
- Excel import

## Quick Start for New Developers

1. **Understand the Models:**
   - Read TASK_MANAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md sections 1.1-1.6
   - Focus on ProjectTask first, then ScheduleTask

2. **See the Frontend:**
   - Look at MasterSchedulePage.jsx in frontend/src/pages/
   - Study GanttChart.jsx and TaskTable.jsx components

3. **Test the API:**
   - Use the endpoints from Quick Reference
   - Test CRUD operations on tasks
   - Try dependency creation (will test circular prevention)

4. **Understand the Data Flow:**
   - Review the "Data Flow" section in Quick Reference
   - See how schedule generation works in generator_service.rb

5. **Plan Your Feature:**
   - Check "What's Missing" section
   - Review recommendations
   - Find related files using location reference

## Common Questions Answered

**Q: Where are tasks stored?**
A: Two systems - ProjectTask table (project planning) and ScheduleTask table (supplier delivery). See TASK_MANAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md sections 1.1 and 1.2.

**Q: How do dependencies work?**
A: TaskDependency model (4 types: FS, SS, FF, SF) with circular prevention. See Architecture section 1.4.

**Q: How is the Gantt chart created?**
A: Backend API returns task data, React components render grid/bars. See Architecture section 2.

**Q: How are users assigned?**
A: Frontend has hardcoded team members. Backend ready but needs dynamic fetching. See Architecture section 3.

**Q: What needs to be built next?**
A: Dynamic user fetching, backward pass, notifications, comments. See Architecture section 10 for recommendations.
