---

## Session & Security

### Auto-Logout

**Your session lasts 24 hours.**

After 24 hours of inactivity:
- You'll see "Unauthorized" error
- Click "Refresh" or navigate to login page
- Log in again to continue

**Why?**
- Security: Prevents unauthorized access on shared computers
- Compliance: Industry best practice

**Pro Tip:** Keep TRAPID tab open and active to avoid logout. But close it when stepping away from your computer!

---

### Security Best Practices

✅ **Do This:**
1. **Use a strong password** (12+ characters, mixed case, special chars)
2. **Don't share your password** (even with coworkers)
3. **Log out when leaving your computer** (or lock screen)
4. **Change password every 3-6 months**
5. **Use Microsoft login if available** (one less password to manage)
6. **Report suspicious activity** to your admin immediately

❌ **Avoid This:**
1. **Don't write password on sticky note** (seriously, don't!)
2. **Don't use same password as other sites** (breaches happen)
3. **Don't share your account** (get them their own account)
4. **Don't save password on shared computers** (only on your personal device)
5. **Don't ignore "Unauthorized" errors** (might indicate security issue)

---

## Troubleshooting Login Issues

### "Invalid email or password"

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong password (check caps lock!)
- Wrong email (try alternate email)
- Account doesn't exist (ask admin to create it)
- Password expired (should auto-prompt for reset, but ask admin if stuck)

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Forgot Password?" to reset
2. Double-check email spelling
3. Contact your admin to verify account exists

---

### "Account locked" (Supplier/Customer Portal Only)

**What it means:**
- Too many failed login attempts (5 attempts)
- Account temporarily locked for 30 minutes

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30 minutes → try again
2. Contact company to unlock your account
3. Verify you're using correct password

**This doesn't happen to internal users** (Admins, Estimators, etc.) - only external portal users.

---

### "Session expired" or "Unauthorized"

**What it means:**
- Your 24-hour session timed out
- You need to log in again

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Refresh" or navigate to login page
2. Log in again with your credentials
3. Continue working

**Not a bug!** This is normal security behavior.

---

### Microsoft Login Not Working

**Possible issues:**
1. **Microsoft account not set up** - Contact IT to create Microsoft 365 account
2. **Permissions denied** - You must approve TRAPID access on first login
3. **Email mismatch** - Microsoft email must match TRAPID email
4. **Token expired** - Try logging out of Microsoft, then back in

**Solutions:**
- Log out of Microsoft completely → try again
- Use standard email/password login instead
- Contact admin if persists

---

### "Too Many Requests" Error

**What it means:**
- You tried logging in too many times too quickly
- Rate limit protection activated (5 attempts per 20 seconds)

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 20 seconds
2. Try logging in again
3. If you've forgotten password, click "Forgot Password?" instead of guessing

**Why this happens:**
- Security: Prevents brute force attacks
- You'll rarely see this unless trying many passwords quickly

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have multiple accounts?

**No.** One account per person. If you need access to different roles, ask your admin to adjust your single account's role.

---

### Can I change my email address?

**No.** Email is your unique identifier. If your email changes (e.g., marriage, job change), contact your admin to update it manually.

---

### How long until my password expires?

**Never.** Passwords don't expire automatically in TRAPID. However, it's good practice to change them every 3-6 months.

---

### Can I use the same password on my phone?

**Yes!** TRAPID is mobile-friendly. Use the same login credentials on any device.

---

### What happens if I forget my password AND can't access my email?

**Contact your admin.** They can reset your password manually and share the new credentials with you securely.

---

### Can I login from multiple devices at once?

**Yes!** You can be logged in on your desktop, laptop, and phone simultaneously. All use the same 24-hour session token.

---

### Why does my session expire after 24 hours?

**Security best practice.** This prevents:
- Unauthorized access on shared computers
- Stale sessions lingering indefinitely
- Security breaches from stolen tokens

**Industry standard:** Most business apps use 12-24 hour sessions.

---

### Can I extend my session without logging out?

**Not currently.** Sessions are hard-limited to 24 hours. Just log in again when prompted - it's quick!

**Future feature:** Auto-refresh tokens to extend sessions indefinitely (coming soon).

---

### What's the difference between my role and my "assigned role"?

**Role:** Your permission level (Admin, Estimator, User, etc.)
**Assigned Role:** Your team/group assignment (Sales, Site, Supervisor, etc.)

- **Role** controls what you CAN do in the system
- **Assigned Role** is for filtering/grouping users (e.g., "Show all Sales users")

**Example:**
- Role: Estimator (can create estimates)
- Assigned Role: Sales (works on sales team)

---

### Can I delete my own account?

**No.** Only admins can delete accounts. Contact your admin if you need your account removed.

---

- Click **"Save"**
- Re-run Gantt cascade (tasks will reschedule to working days)

---

**Solution:**
Ensure password has:
- At least 12 characters
- Uppercase + lowercase + digit + special character
- Example: `Construction2025!`

---

**Issue: User can't access Settings page**

**Cause:** User role is not Admin or Product Owner.

- Only Admins and Product Owners can access Settings
- Go to **Settings** → **"Users"**
- Find user and change **Role** to **Admin**
- User must log out and back in to see Settings

# Chapter 3: Managing Contacts

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📖 BIBLE (RULES):      Chapter 3 (Developers)  │
│ 📕 LEXICON (BUGS):     Chapter 3 (Developers)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16 09:01 AEST

## What are Contacts?

Contacts are the people and businesses you work with - customers, suppliers, sales reps, and land agents. Trapid's contact system is flexible, allowing each contact to have multiple roles (for example, a business can be both a customer and a supplier).

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-role Contacts:** Mark contacts as customers, suppliers, or both
- **Xero Integration:** Automatic two-way sync with Xero accounting
- **Contact Relationships:** Link related businesses (parent companies, referrals, partners)
- **Portal Access:** Give suppliers and customers secure access to their information
- **Activity History:** Complete timeline of all interactions and changes

---

## Quick Start

### Adding a New Contact

1. Navigate to **Contacts** from the main menu
2. Click **+ New Contact**
3. Enter basic information:
   - Full name or company name
   - Email address
   - Phone number
   - Contact type (customer, supplier, or both)
4. Click **Save**

**Tip:** Add the ABN (Australian Business Number) if available - this helps prevent duplicates when syncing with Xero.

---

### Contact Types Explained

**Customer:**
- Businesses or people who hire you for construction projects
- Linked to jobs and estimates
- Can access customer portal to view project progress

**Supplier:**
- Vendors who provide materials or services
- Linked to purchase orders and pricebook items
- Can access supplier portal to view and manage POs

**Both (Customer + Supplier):**
- Common in construction (e.g., a plumber who both hires you and provides specialized services)
- Has access to all features for both roles

**Sales:**
- External sales representatives or agents
- Linked to customer relationships

**Land Agent:**
- Real estate agents or land developers
- Linked to property information

---

## Key Features

### Contact Relationships

Link related contacts to track business connections:

**How to Add a Relationship:**
1. Open a contact
2. Go to **Relationships** tab
3. Click **+ Add Relationship**
4. Select the related contact and relationship type:
   - Previous Client
   - Parent Company / Subsidiary
   - Partner
   - Referral
   - Other
5. Add optional notes
6. Click **Save**

Relationships are automatically bidirectional - adding "Company A → Parent of Company B" also creates "Company B → Subsidiary of Company A".

---

### Xero Sync

Trapid automatically syncs contacts with Xero accounting software:

**What Syncs:**
- Contact names and company details
- Email addresses and phone numbers
- Banking details and payment terms
- Tax numbers (ABN/ACN)
- Contact groups from Xero

**How It Works:**
- **Automatic Matching:** Trapid matches contacts by ABN, email, or name
- **Two-way Sync:** Changes in either system update the other
- **Manual Linking:** You can manually link contacts if auto-match doesn't work

**To Manually Link a Contact to Xero:**
1. Open the contact
2. Click **Link to Xero**
3. Search for the Xero contact
4. Click **Link**

---

### Portal Access (for Suppliers and Customers)

Give contacts secure access to view their information:

**How to Enable Portal Access:**
1. Open a contact (must be customer or supplier type)
2. Click **Enable Portal Access**
3. Enter the portal email address
4. Set a temporary password (user will be prompted to change it)
5. Click **Create Portal User**

**What Portal Users Can Do:**
- **Customers:** View job progress, estimates, and invoices

## Troubleshooting

### "Xero sync created duplicate contacts"

**Problem:** Same business appears twice after Xero sync

**Solution:**
1. Use the **Merge Contacts** feature to combine duplicates
2. In future, add ABN to contacts before syncing (prevents duplicates)
3. Or manually link the contact to Xero before running auto-sync

---

### "Can't delete a contact"

**Problem:** Delete button greyed out or error message appears

**Cause:** Contact has linked purchase orders or financial records

**Solution:**
- Review what's linked to the contact (check POs, jobs)
- If safe to remove, delete those records first
- If not safe, use **Merge** instead to consolidate with another contact
- Or mark contact as inactive instead of deleting

---

### "Portal login not working for supplier"

**Problem:** Supplier can't access portal after receiving login credentials

**Possible Solutions:**
1. **Check account lockout:** Wait 30 minutes or reset password
2. **Verify portal type:** Ensure they're using the supplier portal URL
3. **Check email address:** Confirm email matches exactly (case-sensitive)
4. **Reset password:** Use "Forgot Password" link to send new reset email

---

### "Contact relationship not showing"

**Problem:** Added a relationship but it's not visible on the related contact

**Solution:**
- Refresh the page - relationships are bidirectional and may need refresh

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16 09:01 AEST

## What are Price Books?

Price Books are your material cost library - storing item prices, supplier information, and categories for all the materials you commonly purchase. They power intelligent features throughout Trapid:

- **Smart PO Generation:** Automatically match estimate items to pricebook entries, auto-filling suppliers and current pricing
- **Price Tracking:** Historical price tracking shows you how material costs change over time
- **Risk Alerts:** Get warnings about outdated or volatile pricing before creating purchase orders
- **Supplier Management:** Associate materials with preferred suppliers and track supplier reliability

The system automatically tracks every price change you make, creating a complete audit trail for cost analysis and budget forecasting.

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Settings → Price Books**
2. Click **"+ Add Item"**
3. Fill in item details:
   - Item name (be descriptive: "2x4x8 Douglas Fir Stud" not just "Stud")
   - Current price
   - Unit (EA, LF, SF, etc.)
   - Supplier
   - Category
4. Click **"Save"**
5. Price history begins automatically as you update prices

---

## Key Features

- **Automatic Price History:** Every price change is tracked automatically with timestamps and user attribution
- **Smart Item Matching:** Fuzzy matching finds items even with typos or slight wording differences (uses Levenshtein distance algorithm)
- **Supplier Normalization:** "Home Depot Inc." and "Home Depot LLC" are recognized as the same supplier
- **Price Volatility Detection:** Statistical analysis (Coefficient of Variation) flags items with unstable pricing
- **Risk Scoring:** Multi-factor scoring (freshness, reliability, volatility, missing data) helps prioritize updates
- **Bulk Updates:** Import CSV files or update multiple items at once with transaction safety

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding Items from Estimates

When generating POs from estimates, unfound items can be added directly:
1. Review estimate line items
2. Click **"Add to Pricebook"** on unmatched items
3. Fill in supplier and category
4. Item is immediately available for future POs

### Updating Prices

Price changes are tracked automatically:
1. Find item in Price Books list
2. Edit price field
3. Save changes
4. System creates price history entry with old/new prices

### Bulk Import

For large catalogs:
1. Export template CSV
2. Fill in item details (name, price, supplier, category, unit)
3. Import CSV
4. Review mapping and validation
5. Confirm import

### Checking Price Volatility

Before generating POs:
1. Open Price Books list
2. Sort by **Risk Score** (highest first)
3. Review high-risk items (red flags)
4. Update stale prices before creating POs

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Item not matching in Smart PO Lookup"

**Problem:** Estimate item doesn't auto-match to pricebook even though it exists

**Solutions:**
- Check spelling - must be at least 70% similar for fuzzy match
- Verify supplier matches if estimate has preferred supplier set
- Add exact item name variation to pricebook
- Remove supplier constraint from estimate to allow broader matching

---

### "High Volatility warning on stable item"

**Problem:** Item shows volatile pricing despite stable prices

**Solutions:**
- Requires at least 5 price history entries for accurate calculation
- Check for outlier entries (typos) and delete them
- Wait for more price updates to build history
- Low-value items naturally have higher % volatility

---

### "Bulk update failed partway through"

**Problem:** Some items updated, others failed, inconsistent state

**Solutions:**
- System uses database transactions - all-or-nothing updates
- Check validation errors on failed items (missing required fields)
- Review error messages and fix data issues
- Re-run bulk update after corrections

## What is Jobs & Construction Management?

Jobs (called "Constructions" in the system) are the central hub for managing construction projects from start to finish. Each job includes:
- **Basic Info:** Job name, site address, contract value, supervisor details
- **Contacts:** Clients, architects, subcontractors linked to this job
- **Financial Tracking:** Live profit calculations based on contract value minus purchase orders
- **Scheduling:** Optional project schedule with tasks, dependencies, and Gantt charts
- **Documentation:** OneDrive folder creation, document tabs, communication history

The system separates the physical job (Construction) from the schedule (Project) - allowing you to create jobs without scheduling, perfect for quotes or small jobs.

---

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to **Jobs** section
2. Click **"+ New Job"**
3. Fill in basic details:
   - Job name/address
   - Contract value
   - Site supervisor info
   - Select contacts
4. Optionally: Choose schedule template to auto-create project timeline
5. Optionally: Enable OneDrive folder creation
6. Click **"Create Job"**

---

## Key Features

- **Live Profit:** Automatically calculates profit as contract value minus all PO costs
- **Schedule Templates:** Pre-built project templates with tasks and dependencies
- **Task Management:** Tasks with status, progress tracking, assignments, and materials
- **Auto-Documentation:** Photo and certificate tasks spawn automatically when work completes
- **OneDrive Integration:** Auto-create folder structure when job is created
- **Contact Linking:** Associate multiple contacts (client, architect, trades) with roles

---

## Common Tasks

### Creating a Job with Schedule

1. Create new job with basic info
2. Select a schedule template from dropdown

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16 09:01 AEST

## What are Estimates?

Estimates are material lists imported from external estimating software (primarily Unreal Engine). Trapid automatically:
- **Matches** estimates to existing jobs using smart fuzzy matching
- **Converts** estimates into draft purchase orders grouped by trade
- **Reviews** estimates against actual construction plans using AI
- **Tracks** where estimates came from and their approval status

Think of estimates as the bridge between your estimating software and Trapid's job management system.

---

## Quick Start

1. **External System Exports Estimate**
   - Unreal Engine sends estimate to Trapid automatically
   - System attempts to match to existing job

2. **Review Match**
   - Check if auto-matched correctly (70%+ confidence)
   - Manually select job if needed

3. **Generate Purchase Orders**
   - Click "Generate POs" button
   - System creates draft POs grouped by trade category
   - Review and approve POs

4. **(Optional) AI Plan Review**
   - Upload construction plans to OneDrive
   - Click "AI Review" to compare estimate to plans
   - Review discrepancies and adjust POs

---

## Key Features

- **Smart Job Matching:** Fuzzy matching finds the right job even with typos or variations
- **Confidence Scoring:** Shows match confidence (70%+ auto-matches, 50-70% suggests candidates)
- **Auto-PO Generation:** Converts estimates to purchase orders automatically by trade
- **AI Plan Review:** Claude AI compares estimate quantities to actual construction plans
- **Status Tracking:** Pending → Matched → Imported workflow

---

## Common Tasks

### Reviewing Auto-Matched Estimate

1. Navigate to **Estimates** tab
2. Check "Auto-Matched" badge and confidence score
3. Verify matched job is correct
4. If incorrect, click "Change Job" and select correct one

### Generating Purchase Orders from Estimate

1. Open estimate detail
2. Verify all line items look correct
3. Click **"Generate Purchase Orders"**
4. System creates draft POs grouped by:
   - Plumbing (all plumbing items)
   - Electrical (all electrical items)
   - Carpentry (all carpentry items)
5. Review draft POs and approve when ready

### Running AI Plan Review

1. Ensure job has plans uploaded to OneDrive ("01 - Plans" folder)
2. Open estimate
3. Click **"AI Review"** button
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for analysis
5. Review discrepancy list:
   - **High severity:** >20% quantity difference
   - **Medium severity:** 10-20% difference
   - **Low severity:** <10% difference
6. Adjust PO quantities based on findings

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Estimate not auto-matched - manual selection needed"
**Problem:** Confidence score below 70%
**Solution:** Click "Select Job" and choose correct job from list. System will show candidates with 50%+ match confidence.

### "Wrong job auto-matched"
**Problem:** Estimate matched to incorrect job despite 72% confidence
**Solution:** Click "Reject Match" → Select correct job from list → Confirm. Future: This feedback helps improve matching algorithm.

### "AI Review shows 'Processing' for 5+ minutes"
**Problem:** Large PDF files causing timeout
**Solution:** Check that plan PDFs are <20MB and <30 pages. If larger, split into multiple files before uploading to OneDrive.

### "Generate POs creates duplicate categories"
**Problem:** "Electrical" and "electrical" create separate POs
**Solution:** Contact support - category normalization should handle this automatically. Temporary fix: Edit one PO to include all items.

- If processing > 5 minutes, contact support

---

### High confidence but missing items flagged
**Problem:** Plans show items you didn't include in estimate.

**Possible causes:**
- Future phase items (not needed now)
- Optional upgrades (not in this quote)
- Alternate materials (plan shows options)

**Solution:**
1. Review "Missing Items" list
2. Determine if items are required THIS phase
3. Add to estimate if necessary
4. Ignore if intentionally excluded

---

### Quantity looks correct but flagged as mismatch

2. Update estimate
3. Re-run review

---

## Tips for Best Results

### Upload Quality Plans
✅ **Do:**
- Use high-resolution PDFs (text readable when zoomed)
- Include all relevant sheets (floor plans, elevations, details)
- Ensure text is searchable (not scanned images if possible)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Hand-drawn sketches (low accuracy)
- Photos of plans (poor quality)
- Incomplete plan sets (missing sheets)

### Organize by Folder
Store plans in correct OneDrive folders for best results:
- **01 - Plans** → Architectural drawings
- **02 - Engineering** → Structural, MEP, civil
- **03 - Specifications** → Material specs, details

### Match Estimate Detail Level
- If plans show "100 SF drywall", don't estimate "100 SF interior finishes"
- Use same item descriptions as plans when possible
- Break down assemblies to match plan detail

### Review Results Critically
- AI is a helper, not a replacement for human judgment
- Verify high-severity discrepancies manually
- Consider context (phasing, alternates, allowances)

## Smart Lookup: How It Works

**Smart Lookup** automatically finds the best supplier and price for each line item.

### How Items Are Matched

**Priority 1:** Exact match (best)
- Item name + your preferred supplier + category
- Example: "Pine Timber 90x45" from "Timber Co" in "Framing" category

**Priority 2:** Fuzzy match
- Similar name + preferred supplier + category
- Example: "Pine Tmber 90x45" matches "Pine Timber 90x45"

**Priority 3:** Any supplier in category
- Item name from any supplier in same category
- Example: "Pine Timber 90x45" from any timber supplier

**Priority 4:** Fallback
- Best available match from entire pricebook
- Better than blank!

### How Suppliers Are Selected

**Priority 1:** Supplier code on estimate
- If estimate specifies "ABC-123", use that supplier

**Priority 2:** Category default supplier
- Each category has preferred supplier (set in Settings)
- Example: "Framing" category → "Timber Co"

**Priority 3:** Any active supplier
- First active supplier with items in category

**Priority 4:** Fallback
- First active supplier in system

**Pro Tip:** Set default suppliers for each category to get accurate smart lookups!

6. PO moves to "Received" status

**Partial deliveries:**
- Note what arrived in comments
- Keep PO in "Sent" status until complete
- Or mark as "Received" and note outstanding items

### Recording Invoices

**When supplier invoice arrives:**

1. Open PO (should be in "Received" status)
2. Click "Mark as Invoiced"
3. **Enter invoice details:**
   - Invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Invoice amount
4. **Attach invoice PDF** (optional but recommended)
5. Click "Save"
6. PO moves to "Invoiced" status

**Payment status auto-calculated:**
- System compares invoice amount to PO total
- Shows "Pending", "Part Payment", or "Complete"
- 5% tolerance for rounding (see Payment Tracking below)

### Recording Payments

1. Open PO in "Invoiced" status
2. **Enter payment details:**
   - Amount paid
   - Payment date
   - Payment method (EFT, check, credit card)
   - Reference number
3. **Click "Record Payment"**
4. **Payment status updates:**
   - If paid in full → "Paid" status (PO closed)
   - If partial → "Part Payment" (can record more payments)

**Multiple payments:**
- Record each payment separately
- System tracks total paid
- Shows balance owing

---

## Understanding Payment Status

### 💰 Payment Status Indicators

**⏳ Pending**
- No payment recorded yet
- Invoice just received
- Action: Schedule payment

**🟡 Part Payment**
- Some amount paid, but not complete
- Example: $500 paid on $1000 PO
- Action: Record remaining payments

**✅ Complete**
- Fully paid (within tolerance)
- Example: $995-$1050 paid on $1000 PO (95-105% tolerance)
- Action: None, PO can close

**🚨 Manual Review**
- Payment doesn't make sense
- Example: $1100 paid on $1000 PO (overpaid!)
- Action: Check with accounts, may need credit

### Why 5% Tolerance?

**Real-world scenarios:**
- **Rounding:** $999.95 vs $1000.00
- **Early payment discounts:** Pay $980 for 2% discount
- **Partial shipments:** Last item $20, not worth separate invoice
- **GST differences:** Calculation rounding

**System considers these "Complete":**
- PO Total: $1000
- Paid: $950-$1050 = Complete ✅
- Paid: $949 or less = Part Payment 🟡
- Paid: $1051+ = Manual Review 🚨

**To override:**
- If $990 paid and supplier agrees that's full payment
- Accept "Part Payment" status (accurate reflection)
- Or adjust invoice amount to $990 → Shows "Complete"

---

## Price Drift Warnings

**What is price drift?**
- Comparison between pricebook price and PO line item price
- Helps catch data entry errors and price increases

**Color indicators:**
- 🟢 **Green (0-5%):** Normal variation, no concern
- 🟡 **Yellow (5-10%):** Notable increase, worth checking
- 🔴 **Red (>10%):** Significant increase, review required

**Common causes:**
- ✅ **Legitimate:** Supplier raised prices, market increase
- ✅ **Bulk pricing:** Ordered more, got discount (negative drift)
- ❌ **Data error:** Typed $1000 instead of $100 (900% drift!)
- ❌ **Wrong item:** Selected wrong pricebook item

**Example:**
- Pricebook: "2x4 Timber" = $5.00
- PO line item: $5.75 (15% drift)
- **Warning shows:** "Price is 15% higher than pricebook. Confirm before proceeding."

**Actions:**
- Review supplier quote
- Check for data entry errors
- Update pricebook if new normal price
- Proceed if increase is legitimate

---

## Linking POs to Schedule Tasks

**Why link?**
- See which POs support which construction phases
- Track material costs per task
- Know when items must arrive for task start date

**How to link:**

1. **Open PO**
2. **Scroll to "Schedule Task" field**
3. **Select task from dropdown:**
   - Shows all tasks for current job
   - Example: "Framing - Week 2"
4. **Click "Save"**

**Result:**
- PO appears in task details
- Task shows associated PO cost
- Delivery date aligned with task start

**Important:**
- One PO can link to ONE task only
- One task can have MULTIPLE POs
- Changing link moves PO to new task (safely handled)

---

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Estimate → PO → Delivery

**Scenario:** Converting approved estimate into supplier orders

1. **Estimate approved** by client
2. **Generate POs** from estimate
   - Click "Generate Purchase Orders"
   - Review auto-created POs
   - Verify suppliers and prices
3. **Submit for approval**
   - Click "Submit All for Approval"
   - Manager reviews and approves
4. **Send to suppliers**
   - Approved POs → Click "Send to Supplier"
   - Email sent automatically
5. **Track deliveries**
   - Items arrive → "Mark as Received"
   - Record invoice → "Mark as Invoiced"
   - Record payment → "Record Payment"
6. **Close PO**
   - Fully paid → Status: "Paid"
   - Archived for records

**Timeline:** 2-3 days for approval, 5-10 days delivery (varies by supplier)

---

### Workflow 2: Emergency Purchase

**Scenario:** Need materials urgently, no estimate yet

1. **Create manual PO**
   - "+ New Purchase Order"
   - Select supplier
   - Add items needed
2. **Submit for approval**
   - Click "Submit for Approval"
   - Call/text manager for quick approval
3. **Call supplier**
   - Confirm availability
   - Arrange pickup or delivery
4. **Send PO**
   - Manager approves → "Send to Supplier"
   - Email or call supplier with PO number
5. **Pick up or receive**
   - Get items on site
   - "Mark as Received"
6. **Process invoice**
   - Invoice arrives → "Mark as Invoiced"
   - Pay ASAP → "Record Payment"

**Timeline:** Same day if supplier has stock

---

### Workflow 3: Bulk Ordering for Multiple Jobs

**Scenario:** Ordering common materials for 3 jobs to get bulk discount

1. **Create PO for primary job**
   - Select job with most items
   - Add ALL items (across all jobs)
   - Note other job numbers in PO notes
2. **Record total cost to primary job**
   - Full PO tracked in primary job
3. **Split costs in accounting**
   - Use custom tables or manual tracking
   - Allocate costs per job

**Alternative (better tracking):**
- Create separate PO per job
- Note bulk order in PO notes
- Coordinate delivery timing

---

## Troubleshooting

### "PO number already exists"

**What it means:** System tried to create duplicate PO number (rare!)

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh page and try again
2. Check existing POs for duplicates
3. Contact support if persists

**Prevention:** System uses database locks to prevent this

---

### "Cannot edit PO in 'Sent' status"

**What it means:** PO already sent to supplier, locked to prevent confusion

**Solutions:**
1. **Minor change:** Contact supplier directly, don't change system
2. **Major change:**
   - Cancel PO
   - Create new PO with correct details
   - Send new PO to supplier
   - Explain cancellation

**Why locked?** Prevents miscommunication with supplier

---

### "Smart lookup selected wrong supplier"

**What it means:** System picked different supplier than you expected

**Solutions:**
1. **Check category default:**
   - Settings → Price Books → Categories
   - Update default supplier if needed
2. **Manually override:**
   - Change supplier in PO after generation
   - Edit line items if needed
3. **Review pricebook:**
   - Ensure correct items are tagged to right suppliers

**Prevention:** Set accurate default suppliers for each category

---

### "Payment status stuck on 'Part Payment'"

**What it means:** Amount paid doesn't fall in "Complete" tolerance (95-105%)

**Example:**
- PO Total: $1000
- Paid: $990 (99% - outside tolerance)
- Shows: "Part Payment"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check if truly complete:**
   - Did supplier accept $990 as full payment?
   - Was there a discount?
2. **Adjust invoice amount:**
   - Change invoice from $1000 to $990
   - Status updates to "Complete"
3. **Pay remaining amount:**
   - Pay additional $10
   - Status updates to "Complete"
4. **Accept status:**
   - "Part Payment" is accurate if not fully paid

**Understanding:** Status is CALCULATED, not manually set

---

### "Price drift warning won't go away"

**What it means:** Line item price is >10% different from pricebook

**Solutions:**
1. **Update pricebook:**
   - Settings → Price Books
   - Update item price to current market price
   - Drift warning disappears
2. **Verify correct price:**
   - Check supplier quote
   - Ensure no data entry error
3. **Acknowledge and proceed:**
   - Click "I understand, proceed"
   - Warning is informational only

**Prevention:** Keep pricebook updated with current market prices

---

### "Cannot link PO to schedule task"

**What it means:** Task already linked to another PO

**Solutions:**
1. **Check existing link:**
   - Open schedule task
   - See which PO is linked
2. **Unlink other PO:**
   - Open that PO
   - Remove schedule task link
   - Now link to new PO
3. **Use different task:**
   - Create new task if needed
   - Link PO to new task

**Why?** System enforces: One task = One PO (one-to-one relationship)

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I edit a PO after it's sent?

**No.** Once sent, PO is locked to prevent supplier confusion.

**To change:** Cancel PO → Create new one → Send new PO to supplier

---

### Why does smart lookup pick different suppliers?

**Reason:** System follows priority:
1. Supplier code on estimate
2. Category default supplier
3. Any active supplier

**Solution:** Set default suppliers in category settings

---

### Can I create POs without an estimate?

**Yes!** Manual PO creation is fully supported.

**Best for:** Change orders, additional items, emergency purchases

---

### What happens if I delete a PO?

**Draft/Pending:** PO deleted permanently
**Approved/Sent/Received/Invoiced/Paid:** Cannot delete (use cancel instead)

**Better:** Use "Cancel" to create audit trail

---

### Can I merge multiple POs?

**No.** System doesn't support merging.

**Workaround:** Create new PO with all items → Cancel old POs

---

### How do I track partial payments?

**Record each payment separately:**
1. Enter amount paid
2. Click "Record Payment"
3. Status updates to "Part Payment"
4. Repeat for next payment

System tracks total paid and balance owing.

---

### Can I copy a PO to another job?

**Not directly.** Must create new PO manually.

**Workaround:**
1. Open original PO
2. Note items and quantities
3. Create new PO in other job
4. Enter same items

**Feature request:** Copy PO function (coming soon!)

---

### What's the difference between "Received" and "Invoiced"?

**Received:** Goods physically delivered to site
**Invoiced:** Supplier invoice recorded in system

**Typical flow:**
1. Items arrive → Mark as "Received"
2. Days/weeks later → Invoice arrives → Mark as "Invoiced"
3. Process payment → Record payments

---

### Can I have multiple invoices for one PO?

**Not directly.** System tracks one invoice per PO.

**For multiple invoices:**
- Use comments to track each invoice number
- Record total amount paid across all invoices
- Attach all invoice PDFs

**Better:** Split into separate POs for each delivery

---

### How do I export PO data for accounting?

**Options:**
1. **Export to CSV:** POs page → "Export" button
2. **Xero Integration:** Auto-sync POs to Xero (if enabled)
3. **API Access:** Custom integration (developer required)

**CSV includes:** PO number, supplier, items, amounts, dates, status

## What is Schedule Master?

Schedule Master helps you create and manage construction timelines with:
- 📅 **Visual Gantt Chart** - See your entire project timeline
- 🔗 **Task Dependencies** - Link tasks that depend on each other
- 📋 **24-Column Table** - Detailed task information
- 🔒 **Lock System** - Prevent important dates from changing
- 🔄 **Auto-Cascade** - Dependent tasks update automatically

---

## Creating Your First Schedule

### Step 1: Navigate to Schedule Master

1. Go to your job
2. Click the **"Schedule"** tab
3. Click **"New Schedule from Template"**

### Step 2: Choose a Template

Pick a template that matches your project type:
- **NDIS Residential** - Disability housing construction
- **Standard Residential** - Regular home construction
- **Commercial** - Commercial building projects
- **Custom** - Start from scratch

### Step 3: Review the Schedule

The template creates tasks for you automatically:
- **Task Name** - What needs to be done (e.g., "Foundation", "Framing")
- **Duration** - How many days each task takes
- **Start Date** - When the task begins
- **Dependencies** - Which tasks must finish first

---

## Understanding the Schedule View

### The Table (Left Side)

**24 columns** show detailed information:
- **Task** - Task name
- **Start** - Start day (e.g., Day 5)
- **Duration** - How long it takes (in days)
- **Predecessors** - Tasks that must finish first
- **Owner** - Who's responsible
- **Status** - Not started, In progress, Complete

### The Gantt Chart (Right Side)

**Visual timeline** shows:
- **Task bars** - Length represents duration
- **Arrows** - Dependencies between tasks
- **Colors** - Different colors for different statuses

---

## Working with Tasks

### Moving a Task

**Drag the task bar** to change its start date:
1. Click and hold on the task bar
2. Drag left (earlier) or right (later)
3. Release to drop

**What happens:**
- Task moves to new date
- All dependent tasks move automatically
- Locked tasks stay in place

### Adding Dependencies

**Link tasks together:**
1. Click the **"Link"** icon next to a task
2. Click the task that depends on it
3. An arrow appears showing the link

**Dependency types:**
- **Finish-to-Start (FS)** - Most common. Task B starts when Task A finishes.
- **Start-to-Start (SS)** - Task B starts when Task A starts.
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)** - Task B finishes when Task A finishes.

### Locking a Task

**Prevent a task from moving:**
1. Find the lock icon column
2. Click the checkbox to lock
3. Locked tasks won't move when predecessors change

**When to lock:**
- ✅ Supplier confirmed the date
- ✅ Work has already started
- ✅ Date is critical (e.g., inspection)

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delay in Foundation

**Problem:** Foundation delayed by 3 days due to rain.

**Solution:**
1. Drag the "Foundation" task bar 3 days later
2. All dependent tasks (Framing, Plumbing, etc.) move automatically
3. Check the new completion date

### Scenario 2: Supplier Confirms Delivery Date

**Problem:** Windows supplier confirmed delivery for Day 45.

**Solution:**
1. Drag "Install Windows" task to Day 45
2. Lock the task (click lock icon)
3. Task won't move even if predecessors change

### Scenario 3: Task Taking Longer Than Expected

**Problem:** Framing taking 5 days instead of 3.

**Solution:**
1. Click on "Framing" task
2. Change **Duration** from 3 to 5
3. All dependent tasks shift by 2 days

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- ✅ **Use templates** - Saves time, proven workflows

│ 📕 LEXICON (BUGS):     Chapter 10 (Developers) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## What are Project Tasks?

Project Tasks are individual work items within a construction job. They track progress, dependencies, assigned workers, and materials. Tasks can spawn automatically (photos, certificates, subtasks) and include supervisor checklists for quality assurance.

**Benefits:**
- **Work breakdown** - Large jobs split into manageable tasks
- **Progress tracking** - See what's done, in progress, or delayed
- **Dependencies** - Know which tasks must finish before others start
- **Supervisor checklists** - Quality and safety checks per task

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: View Tasks for a Job

1. Open a **Job** from the Jobs page
2. Go to **Tasks** tab (or **Schedule Master** view)
3. See list of tasks with:
   - **Name** - Task description
   - **Status** - Not Started, In Progress, Complete, On Hold
   - **Dates** - Planned start/end, actual start/end
   - **Assigned To** - Who's responsible

**Automatic Creation:**
- If job created from Schedule Master template, tasks auto-created from template
- Otherwise, add tasks manually

---

### Step 2: Mark Task In Progress

When work starts on a task:

1. Find task in list
2. Click **status dropdown**
3. Select **"In Progress"**
4. System automatically sets **Actual Start Date** to today

**What happens:**
- If task has **subtasks** configured, they spawn automatically
- Task appears in "In Progress" filter
- Team can see work has started

---

### Step 3: Mark Task Complete

When task work is finished:

1. Find task in list
2. Click **status dropdown**
3. Select **"Complete"**
4. System automatically:
   - Sets **Actual End Date** to today
   - Sets **Progress** to 100%
   - Spawns **photo task** (if required)
   - Spawns **certificate task** (if required)

**Auto-completion:**
- If task has "Auto-complete predecessors" enabled, all tasks it depends on also complete automatically

---

## Key Features

**Task Status Lifecycle:**
- **Not Started** → Task planned but work hasn't begun
- **In Progress** → Work currently happening
- **Complete** → Task finished and verified
- **On Hold** → Blocked or delayed (can resume later)

**Automatic Task Spawning:**
- **Photo Tasks** - Spawned when parent completes (documentation)
- **Certificate Tasks** - Spawned with lag days after parent completes (compliance)
- **Subtasks** - Spawned when parent starts (work breakdown)

**Dependencies:**
- Tasks can depend on other tasks (predecessors)
- Dependency types: Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, Finish-to-Finish
- Prevents scheduling conflicts

**Supervisor Checklists:**
- Safety checks ("Hard hats required")
- Quality checks ("Inspect slab for cracks")
- Photo requirements ("Photo of completed framing")
- Note requirements ("Describe any defects found")

**Materials Tracking:**
- Tasks can link to purchase orders
- System shows if materials arrive on time or delayed
- Prevents starting tasks without materials

---

## Common Tasks

### Create a New Task

1. Go to **Job** → **Tasks** tab
2. Click **"Add Task"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** - "Install kitchen cabinets"
   - **Duration** - Number of days (minimum 1)
   - **Planned Start Date** - When task should begin
   - **Assigned To** - Select worker or enter supplier name
4. Click **"Save"**

**Result:** Task appears in list with "Not Started" status.

---

### Add Task Dependency

To make Task B wait for Task A to finish:

1. Open **Task B** in edit mode
2. Find **"Dependencies"** section
3. Click **"Add Predecessor"**
4. Select **Task A** from dropdown
5. Select dependency type:
   - **Finish-to-Start** (most common) - B starts after A finishes
   - **Start-to-Start** - B starts when A starts
   - **Finish-to-Finish** - B finishes when A finishes
6. Click **"Save"**

**Result:** Task B cannot start until Task A completes (if using Finish-to-Start).

---

### View Supervisor Checklist (Template Setup)

**Note:** This feature is configured in Settings by admins. Field supervisors will complete checklists during job execution (UI coming soon).

1. Go to **Settings** → **Supervisor Checklists**
2. See list of checklist templates:
   - Safety items
   - Quality checks
   - Pre-start requirements
   - Completion verification
3. Click **template** to edit

**Checklist Types:**
- **Checkbox** - Simple yes/no ("Hard hats worn?")
- **Photo** - Requires photo upload ("Photo of slab")
- **Note** - Requires text explanation ("Describe defects")
- **Photo + Note** - Both required

---

### Link Task to Purchase Order

To track if materials arrive on time:

1. Open **Task** in edit mode
2. Find **"Purchase Order"** field
3. Select PO from dropdown
4. Check **"Critical PO"** if materials MUST arrive on time
5. Click **"Save"**

**Result:**
- Task shows materials status badge:
  - **No PO** (gray) - No materials linked
  - **On Time** (green) - PO delivery before task start
  - **Delayed** (red) - PO delivery after task start

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Task won't mark complete**

**Cause:** Task has incomplete dependencies or required checklist items.

**Solution:**
- Check if task has predecessors that aren't complete yet
- Check if supervisor checklist items need completion
- If you need to override, use "On Hold" status temporarily

---

**Issue: Can't add dependency - "Circular dependency detected"**

**Cause:** Creating this dependency would cause a loop (A depends on B, B depends on C, C depends on A).

**Solution:**
- Review dependency chain to find the loop
- Remove one dependency to break the cycle
- Example: If A→B→C→A, remove either A→B, B→C, or C→A

---

**Issue: Subtasks didn't spawn when task started**

**Cause:** Template row doesn't have "Has Subtasks" enabled.

**Solution:**
- Go to **Settings** → **Schedule Master** → **Templates**
- Edit the template row for this task type
- Enable **"Has Subtasks"** checkbox
- Configure subtask templates
- Future jobs will spawn subtasks correctly (existing jobs must add manually)

# Chapter 11: Weather Tracking & Delays

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📖 BIBLE (RULES):      Chapter 11 (Developers) │
│ 📕 LEXICON (BUGS):     Chapter 11 (Developers) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## What is Weather Tracking?

Weather Tracking automatically logs rainfall and public holidays for your construction jobs. When it rains, the system records the amount and calculates severity. Public holidays are automatically recognized by region so your schedule knows when crews won't be working.

**Benefits:**
- **Automatic rain logging** - Weather data fetched daily at midnight
- **Public holiday calendar** - Regional holidays (QLD, NSW, VIC, etc.) prevent scheduling conflicts
- **Schedule integration** - Gantt respects non-working days and holidays
- **Delay documentation** - Rain history provides evidence for time extensions

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: View Rain History

1. Open a **Job**
2. Go to **Weather** tab
3. See list of rain events:
   - **Date** - When it rained
   - **Amount** - Rainfall in mm
   - **Severity** - Light (<5mm), Moderate (5-15mm), Heavy (>15mm)
   - **Impact** - Work stopped? Delays caused?

**Automatic Logging:**
- System checks weather API daily at midnight
- Extracts location from job title or address
- Records rainfall if > 0mm
- Calculates severity automatically

---

### Step 2: Add Manual Rain Entry

If automatic logging missed a rain event:

1. Open **Job** → **Weather** tab
2. Click **"Add Rain Event"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Date** - When it rained
   - **Rainfall (mm)** - Amount measured on site
   - **Notes** - Impact description (optional)
4. Click **"Save"**

**Tip:** Severity auto-calculates from rainfall amount. You don't need to select it manually.

---

### Step 3: Check Public Holidays

1. Go to **Settings** → **Public Holidays**
2. See calendar of upcoming holidays by region:
   - **National Holidays** - Australia-wide (e.g., Christmas Day)
   - **Regional Holidays** - State-specific (e.g., Melbourne Cup - VIC only)
3. Filter by region: QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, WA, TAS, NT, NZ

**Schedule Integration:**
- Gantt automatically skips public holidays when calculating task dates
- Working day logic respects company working days + public holidays
- Lock hierarchy prevents tasks from being scheduled on holidays

---

## Key Features

**Automatic Weather Tracking:**
- Daily midnight check for yesterday's rainfall
- Location extracted from job title (e.g., "House Build - Springfield, QLD")
- Severity auto-calculated based on rainfall amount
- Historical data stored permanently

**Regional Public Holidays:**
- Unique holidays per region (no duplicates)
- Covers all Australian states + New Zealand
- Used by Schedule Master for working day calculations

**Schedule Integration:**
- Gantt respects both working days AND public holidays
- Task dates auto-adjust to skip non-working days
- Manual override via lock hierarchy if needed

**Rain History Documentation:**
- Evidence for contract variations
- Time extension justification
- Weather delay tracking per job

---

## Common Tasks

### Add a Custom Public Holiday

If your region has a local holiday not in the system:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Public Holidays**
2. Click **"Add Holiday"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** - "Local Show Day"
   - **Date** - Select from calendar
   - **Region** - QLD (or your region)
4. Click **"Save"**

**Result:** Schedule Master now skips this date when calculating task dates for jobs in that region.

---

### View Rain Impact on Schedule

1. Open **Job** → **Gantt** tab
2. See if any tasks were delayed by rain:
   - Tasks with weather delays show rain icon
   - Hover over icon to see rain event details
3. Check **Weather** tab to see full rain history

**Tip:** Use rain history to justify time extensions to clients or generate variation requests.

---

### Manual Rainfall Entry for Historical Jobs

If you're migrating an old job with known rain delays:

1. Open **Job** → **Weather** tab
2. Click **"Add Rain Event"** for each historical event
3. Enter date, rainfall amount, and impact notes
4. System stores as permanent record

**Benefit:** Complete weather history for contract documentation.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Automatic rain check not working**

**Cause:** Job location unclear or API limit exceeded.

**Solution:**
- Ensure job title includes suburb + region: "House Build - Springfield, QLD"
- Or add full address in Job Details
- Check Settings → Integrations to verify WeatherAPI is connected

---

**Issue: Wrong location being used for weather**

**Cause:** Ambiguous suburb name (e.g., "Springfield" exists in NSW and QLD).

**Solution:**
- Include state/region in job title: "Springfield, QLD" not just "Springfield"
- Or add full street address in Job Details
- System prioritizes: Address > Job title > Job site address > Contact address

---

**Issue: Public holiday not recognized**

**Cause:** Holiday might be region-specific or not in database.

**Solution:**
- Check Settings → Public Holidays to see if it exists
- Add manually if it's a local holiday
- Ensure job's region matches the holiday's region

### Tip #3: Use Reference Numbers

When recording payments, use the bank transaction reference.

**Example:** "NAB-TRANSFER-12345"

**Why?**

# Chapter 16: Payment Tracking

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📖 BIBLE (RULES):      Chapter 16 (Developers) │
│ 📕 LEXICON (BUGS):     Chapter 16 (Developers) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-16

## What is Payment Tracking?

Payment tracking helps you record and monitor all payments made against purchase orders. The system tracks payment history, calculates remaining balances, and automatically syncs with Xero accounting software for accurate financial reporting.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Payment History** - See all payments made against each purchase order
- **Automatic Status Updates** - Payment status updates based on amounts paid
- **Xero Integration** - Payments sync automatically to your accounting software
- **Budget Monitoring** - Track spending against budgeted amounts

All financial data uses precise decimal calculations to ensure accuracy down to the cent.

---

## Getting Started

### Recording a Payment

1. Open a **Purchase Order** detail page
2. Scroll to the **Payments** section
3. Click **"Record Payment"** button
4. Fill in payment details:
   - **Amount**: Enter the payment amount (e.g., $1,234.56)
   - **Payment Date**: Select when payment was made
   - **Payment Method**: Choose from Bank Transfer, EFT, Check, Credit Card, Cash, or Other
   - **Reference Number**: Enter check number or transaction reference (optional)
   - **Notes**: Add any additional details (optional)
5. Click **"Save Payment"**

**The payment summary updates automatically showing total paid and remaining balance.**

### Understanding Payment Status

Purchase orders display a payment status badge with four states:

- **Pending** (Gray) - No payments recorded yet
- **Partial Payment** (Yellow) - Some amount paid, but not complete
- **Paid** (Green) - Fully paid (within 5% tolerance)
- **Needs Review** (Red) - Overpayment detected, requires manual review

**Status updates automatically as you record payments.**

### Viewing Payment History

On any Purchase Order page:

1. Look for the **Payments** section
2. View the **payment summary box** showing:
   - PO Total
   - Total Paid (green)
   - Remaining (red)
3. Scroll down to see **payment timeline** with:
   - Payment amount
   - Date paid
   - Payment method
   - Reference number
   - Who recorded the payment
   - Xero sync status (green checkmark if synced)

---

## Common Tasks

### Using "Pay Remaining" Quick Action

When making a final payment:

1. Click **"Record Payment"**
2. Click the **"Use remaining amount"** button
3. The amount field auto-fills with the remaining balance
4. Select payment method and reference
5. Click **"Save Payment"**

**This ensures exact payment amounts without manual calculation.**

### Matching Xero Invoices

If you use Xero accounting:

1. Open a Purchase Order
2. Click **"Match Xero Invoice"** button
3. Search for the invoice by number, supplier, or reference
4. Click **"Match to PO"** next to the correct invoice
5. Confirm the match

**The system automatically:**
- Links the invoice to the PO
- Updates payment status
- Syncs payment data to Xero

### Checking Budget Variance

If a PO has a budget set:

1. Open the Purchase Order
2. Look for the **Budget** section
3. View:
   - **Budgeted Amount**: Original budget
   - **Actual Amount**: Current PO total
   - **Variance**: Difference (red if over, green if under)

**Over-budget POs are highlighted in red for visibility.**

### Deleting an Incorrect Payment

1. Navigate to the Purchase Order
2. Find the payment in the payment timeline
3. Click the red **trash icon** next to the payment
4. Confirm deletion

**Warning:** This will update the PO payment status and remaining balance. Deleted payments cannot be recovered.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Status Shows "Needs Review"

**Problem:** The payment status badge is red and shows "Needs Review."

**Cause:** The total paid amount exceeds the PO total by more than 5% or $1.

**Solution:**
1. Check the payment history for errors
2. Verify the PO total is correct
3. If overpayment is intentional (e.g., rush fees, shipping), note it in the payment notes
4. Contact your manager to approve the overage

---

### Xero Sync Failed

**Problem:** Payment shows a red X icon instead of green checkmark for Xero sync.

**Cause:** The payment failed to sync to Xero (network issue, authentication expired, or invoice not matched).

**Solution:**
1. Ensure the PO has a matched Xero invoice first
2. Click the **"Sync to Xero"** button to retry
3. If sync continues to fail, check Xero connection status (Settings → Xero Integration)
4. Contact your administrator if the problem persists

---

### Can't Find a Payment

**Problem:** You recorded a payment but can't see it in the timeline.

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're viewing the correct Purchase Order
2. Scroll down to the Payments section (below PO details)
3. Check the payment summary box shows updated Total Paid
4. Refresh the page (F5)
5. If still missing, check if payment was recorded on a different PO

---

### Remaining Balance Doesn't Match

**Problem:** The "Remaining" amount doesn't match your calculations.

**Explanation:** The system calculates:
- **Remaining = PO Total - Total Paid**

**Check:**
1. Verify the PO Total hasn't changed (line items updated?)
2. Sum all payments in the timeline manually
3. Ensure no payments were deleted or modified
4. If discrepancy persists, contact support with PO number
