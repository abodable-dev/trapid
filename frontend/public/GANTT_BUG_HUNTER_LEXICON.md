## Bug Hunter Tool

### What is Bug Hunter?

Bug Hunter is an automated testing system with two components:

1. **Browser Console Diagnostics** - Real-time monitoring tool that runs in the browser console to detect:
   - Duplicate API calls (infinite loops)
   - Excessive Gantt reloads
   - Slow drag operations
   - Cascade timing issues

2. **Automated Test Suite** - Backend-driven test suite accessible at:
   - **URL:** `http://localhost:5173/settings?tab=schedule-master&subtab=bug-hunter`
   - **Purpose:** Run automated tests to verify Gantt functionality and performance
   - **Features:** Visual feedback mode, test history tracking, template-based testing

### When Bug Hunter Was Created

## Resolved Issues

### ✅ BUG-003: Predecessor IDs Cleared on Drag Operations (RESOLVED)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Discovered:** 2025-11-16 (Bug Hunter automated scan)
**Date Resolved:** 2025-11-16
**Severity:** Critical (Data loss)
**Resolution Time:** ~15 minutes (detection to fix)

#### Summary

When dragging tasks in the Gantt chart, predecessor relationships were being **deleted permanently** due to hardcoded empty arrays in the drag handler. This violated **RULE #9** from the Gantt Bible.

#### Root Cause

**The code was setting `predecessor_ids: []` instead of preserving existing predecessors!**

Two drag code paths were affected:

1. **Path 1:** Task has successors (triggers cascade) - Line 2078
2. **Path 2:** Task has no dependencies (manually positioned) - Line 2096

Both paths hardcoded `predecessor_ids: []`, which cleared all predecessor relationships when saved to the backend.

#### Evidence

**Before (WRONG):**
```javascript
// Line 2074-2079: Task has successors - cascade trigger
const updateData = {
  duration: task.duration,
  start_date: dayOffset,
  manually_positioned: false,
  predecessor_ids: []  // ❌ CLEARS all predecessors!
}

// Line 2092-2097: Independent task (no deps)
const updateData = {
  duration: task.duration,
  start_date: dayOffset,
  manually_positioned: true,
  predecessor_ids: []  // ❌ CLEARS all predecessors!
}
```

**Data Loss Scenario:**
1. Task A depends on Tasks 1, 2, and 3 (has predecessors)
2. Task B depends on Task A (so Task A has successors)
3. User drags Task A to a new date
4. Code detects successors → enters cascade path
5. Sets `predecessor_ids: []` → **Deletes Task A's dependencies!**
6. Backend saves empty array → relationships lost permanently
7. User's dependency graph is corrupted

#### Solution

**Fixed by preserving existing predecessor_ids:**

```javascript
// Line 2078: Task has successors - FIXED
const updateData = {
  duration: task.duration,
  start_date: dayOffset,
  manually_positioned: false,
  predecessor_ids: task.predecessor_ids || []  // ✅ RULE #9: ALWAYS preserve
}

// Line 2096: Independent task - FIXED
const updateData = {
  duration: task.duration,
  start_date: dayOffset,
  manually_positioned: true,
  predecessor_ids: task.predecessor_ids || []  // ✅ RULE #9: ALWAYS preserve
}
```

**Why `|| []`?**
Fallback to empty array only if task truly has no predecessors (undefined/null). This is safe because we're preserving the actual data.

#### Files Changed

- `frontend/src/components/schedule-master/DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:2078` - Fixed cascade path
- `frontend/src/components/schedule-master/DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:2096` - Fixed independent path

#### How Bug Was Discovered

**Discovery Method:** Bug Hunter agent automated scan (2025-11-16)

The bug hunter agent:
1. Read all 13 RULES from Gantt Bible
2. Verified RULE #9: "ALWAYS include predecessor_ids in every update"
3. Searched DHtmlxGanttView.jsx for all `predecessor_ids` usages
4. Found 2 violations where `predecessor_ids: []` was hardcoded
5. Compared with correct code (lines 2023, 2139, 3715) that preserve values
6. Flagged as CRITICAL due to data loss potential

#### Impact Assessment

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Data Loss:** YES - Permanent deletion of predecessor relationships
**User Impact:** HIGH - Breaks dependency tracking, corrupts schedules
**Frequency:** Every drag operation on tasks with both predecessors AND successors

**Why Not Caught Earlier:**
- Bug only affects tasks that have BOTH predecessors AND successors
- Visual Gantt shows tasks in new positions (looks correct)
- Data loss only visible when reopening Gantt or checking database
- No error messages - silent data corruption

#### Comparison with Other Code

**Working Code Examples (for reference):**

```javascript
// Line 2023: Conflict resolution - ✅ CORRECT
predecessor_ids: task.predecessor_ids || []

// Line 2139: Cascade path - ✅ CORRECT
predecessor_ids: task.predecessor_ids || []

// Line 3715: Lock unlock - ✅ CORRECT
predecessor_ids: task.predecessor_ids || []
```

These three locations correctly preserve predecessor_ids. The bug was in the other two drag paths.

#### Key Learnings

1. **RULE #9 is Critical** - NEVER omit predecessor_ids from ANY update, even if you think they're not relevant to the operation

2. **Automated Testing Catches Violations** - Bug Hunter agent successfully detected this by comparing code against documented rules

3. **Data Preservation First** - When in doubt, always preserve existing data rather than clearing it

4. **Visual Testing Isn't Enough** - The Gantt looked correct visually, but data was being lost silently

5. **Compare All Code Paths** - When fixing one path correctly (lines 2023, 2139, 3715), ensure ALL similar paths are also fixed

#### Testing Performed

- [x] ✅ Code review: Verified both fixes preserve predecessor_ids
- [x] ✅ Grep search: Confirmed no other instances of `predecessor_ids: []` remain
- [x] ✅ RULE #9 compliance: Both paths now follow the rule
- [ ] Manual test: Drag task with both predecessors and successors (recommended)
- [ ] Database verification: Check predecessors saved correctly after drag

### ✅ BUG-001: Drag Flickering / Screen Shake (RESOLVED)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Discovered:** 2025-11-14
**Date Resolved:** 2025-11-14
**Severity:** High (UX-breaking)
**Resolution Time:** ~6 hours of investigation + iteration

#### Summary

Screen shake and visible flickering occurred when dragging tasks with dependencies in the DHtmlx Gantt chart. Multiple cascading Gantt reloads caused severe performance issues and poor user experience.

#### Root Cause

**The lock was being set TOO LATE!**

1. User drags Task 299 (has successors: 300, 301, 302, 304)
2. DHtmlx `auto_scheduling` plugin recalculates all dependent tasks
3. Each recalculated task fires `onAfterTaskUpdate` event
4. Each event triggers: `handleTaskUpdate` → API call → state update → Gantt reload
5. **Problem:** `isLoadingData` lock was set in useEffect AFTER state updates had already queued
6. All cascade updates bypassed the lock
7. **Result:** 8 separate Gantt reloads within ~1 second = visible screen shake

#### Investigation Timeline

**8 Iterative Fixes** were attempted before finding the root cause:

1. **Fix #1:** Added `skipReload` option to parent component
   - Reduced flickering but didn't eliminate it

2. **Fix #2:** Batched multi-field updates into single API call
   - Reduced API calls but shake persisted

3. **Fix #3:** Enhanced body scroll lock with `position: fixed`
   - Fixed background shake on modal open, drag shake remained

4. **Fix #4:** Added GPU acceleration with CSS transforms
   - Improved rendering performance but didn't fix core issue

5. **Fix #5:** Added render suppression flag
   - Reduced some flickering but shake persisted

6. **Fix #6:** Deferred `isDragging` flag reset with `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Smoother transitions but still had cascade reload issue

7. **Fix #7:** Modified timeout logic to prevent overlapping timeouts
   - Slowed down reloads but didn't prevent them (8 reloads still happening)

8. **✅ Fix #8: FINAL SOLUTION** - Early lock + cascade API block
   - **Part A:** Set `isLoadingData.current = true` IMMEDIATELY in `onAfterTaskDrag` (before auto-scheduling fires cascade)
   - **Part B:** Block cascade API calls in `handleTaskUpdate` by checking `isLoadingData.current`
   - **Result:** Zero cascade reloads, smooth drag, no screen shake

#### Solution Details

**Two-Part Fix:**

**Part A: Set Lock Immediately** (`DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:1343-1361`)
```javascript
gantt.attachEvent('onAfterTaskDrag', (id, mode, event) => {
  // CRITICAL: Set drag lock IMMEDIATELY to prevent cascade API calls
  // Auto-scheduling plugin will recalculate dependent tasks and fire onAfterTaskUpdate
  // for each one. This lock prevents handleTaskUpdate from making API calls for those.
  isLoadingData.current = true

  // Clear any existing timeout first
  if (loadingDataTimeout.current) {
    clearTimeout(loadingDataTimeout.current)
    loadingDataTimeout.current = null
  }

  // Set timeout to release lock after 1000ms
  loadingDataTimeout.current = setTimeout(() => {
    isLoadingData.current = false
    loadingDataTimeout.current = null
  }, 1000)

  // ... rest of handler
})
```

**Part B: Block Cascade API Calls** (`DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:3247-3365`)
```javascript
const handleTaskUpdate = (task) => {
  // Skip if we're currently saving (prevents infinite loops)
  if (isSaving.current) {
    return
  }

  // Skip saving during drag - onAfterTaskDrag will handle it
  if (isDragging.current) {
    return
  }

  // Skip saving during drag lock period (prevents cascade API calls)
  // This prevents 8+ API calls when dragging a task with dependents
  if (isLoadingData.current) {
    console.log('⏸️ Skipping cascade update - drag lock active')
    return
  }

  // ... proceed with API call
}
```

#### Files Changed

- `DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:1346` - Early lock in onAfterTaskDrag
- `DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:3361` - Cascade API block in handleTaskUpdate
- `MasterSchedulePage.jsx:45-95` - Skip reload option

#### Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API calls per drag | 8-12 | 1 | 87.5% reduction |
| Gantt reloads | 8-12 | 1 | 87.5% reduction |
| Visible shake | YES (severe) | NO | Eliminated ✅ |
| User experience | Poor | Smooth | Professional ✅ |

#### Key Learnings

1. **Timing is Everything** - Setting locks AFTER state updates have queued doesn't work. Locks must be set BEFORE events that trigger state updates.

2. **Auto-Scheduling is Powerful** - DHtmlx's auto-scheduling plugin provides great UX (visual feedback) but triggers many internal events. Understanding event order is critical.

3. **Diagnostic Logging is Essential** - Without timestamped diagnostic logs, it would have been impossible to identify the 8 cascade reloads and their timing.

4. **State vs Refs** - Using `useRef` for control flags prevents unnecessary re-renders while still providing synchronization.

5. **React State Queue** - Multiple `setState` calls can queue up before the first one executes. Checks in useEffect may run too late to prevent cascades.

6. **Visual Feedback ≠ API Calls** - You can have smooth visual updates during drag without making API calls. Separate the visual layer from the data layer.

#### Testing Performed

- [x] Drag a task with NO dependencies → smooth, no shake
- [x] Drag a task WITH 1-2 dependencies → smooth, dependents move visually
- [x] Drag a task WITH 5+ dependencies → smooth, no shake, no multiple reloads
- [x] Console logs → SINGLE "🔄 Gantt reload" after 1000ms lock expires
- [x] Network tab → SINGLE API call for dragged task (not 8+)
- [x] Background page → no shake during any drag operation

#### Bug Hunter Results

**Before Fix:**
```
🚨 Status: CRITICAL
⚠️  WARNING (Critical): Excessive Gantt reloads detected (8 in 1000ms)
⚠️  WARNING (High): Duplicate API calls for task 300 (3 calls)
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Status: HEALTHY
📊 API Calls: 1, Gantt Reloads: 1, No warnings
```

### ✅ BUG-002: Infinite Cascade Loop After Drag (RESOLVED)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Date Discovered:** 2025-11-14 (same day as BUG-001 fix)
**Date Resolved:** 2025-11-14
**Severity:** Critical
**Component:** ScheduleTemplateEditor, DHtmlxGanttView

#### Summary

After fixing BUG-001 (drag flickering), a new issue emerged: cascaded tasks triggered infinite API loops with 20+ duplicate calls within seconds after drag operations. Bug Hunter detected excessive duplicate API calls, causing performance issues.

#### Root Cause

**The pending tracker was cleared too early - before Gantt reload completed!**

Race condition timeline:
1. User drags Task 1 → triggers cascade to Task 2 and Task 3
2. Backend returns cascade data: `{start_date: 8}` for both tasks
3. Frontend calls `handleUpdateRow(300, {start_date: 8})` → API call completes
4. **`finally` block immediately clears pending tracker for task 300** ⚠️
5. `applyBatchedCascadeUpdates()` applies state update
6. Gantt reloads with new data
7. **Gantt reload fires events** → `handleUpdateRow(300, {start_date: 8})` called AGAIN
8. **Pending tracker is empty** → duplicate passes through! → Loop continues
9. Steps 3-8 repeat indefinitely

**The Critical Timing Issue:**
- Pending tracker was cleared in `finally` block immediately after API completes
- But state updates and Gantt reloads happened AFTER clearing
- When Gantt reload fired events, pending tracker was already empty
- No protection against duplicates

#### Solution

**Three-part atomic deduplication fix:**

**1. Atomic Check-and-Set** (`ScheduleTemplateEditor.jsx:734-778`)
```javascript
// Use for...of loop for atomic check-and-set
for (const field of Object.keys(updates)) {
  const newValue = updates[field]
  const currentValue = currentRow[field]
  const pendingKey = `${rowId}:${field}`

  // Check BOTH pending tracker AND current state
  if (pendingUpdatesRef.current.has(pendingKey)) {
    const pendingValue = pendingUpdatesRef.current.get(pendingKey)
    if (pendingValue === newValue) {
      console.log('⏭️ Skipping - same value already pending')
      continue  // Skip this field
    }
  }

  if (currentValue === newValue) {
    console.log('⏭️ Skipping - same value as current')
    continue
  }

  // IMMEDIATELY set pending value (atomic operation)
  pendingUpdatesRef.current.set(pendingKey, newValue)
  fieldsToUpdate[field] = newValue
}
```

**2. Delayed Pending Cleanup** (`ScheduleTemplateEditor.jsx:914-923`)
```javascript
// Clear pending tracker AFTER 2 seconds (not immediately)
// Allows state updates, batch operations, and Gantt reloads to complete
setTimeout(() => {
  Object.keys(updates).forEach(field => {
    const pendingKey = `${rowId}:${field}`
    pendingUpdatesRef.current.delete(pendingKey)
    console.log('🧹 Clearing pending:', pendingKey)
  })
}, 2000)  // Changed from immediate to 2 second delay
```

**3. Detailed Debug Logging**
```javascript
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - Checking row', rowId, '| Pending map size:', pendingUpdatesRef.current.size)
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - Field', field, ': pending=', pendingValue, ', current=', currentValue, ', new=', newValue)
```

#### Files Changed

- `ScheduleTemplateEditor.jsx:727-786` - Atomic deduplication with detailed logging
- `ScheduleTemplateEditor.jsx:914-923` - Delayed pending cleanup (2 seconds)
- `DHtmlxGanttView.jsx:3736-3757` - Auto-scroll to non-completed tasks

#### Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| API calls per cascade | 20+ (infinite) | 2 | 90% reduction |
| Duplicate call warnings | Many | 0 | Eliminated ✅ |
| Cascade update time | Infinite loop | <500ms | Fixed ✅ |
| Bug Hunter warnings | Critical | None | Healthy ✅ |

#### Expected Console Output (After Fix)

```
✅ Proceeding with API call - 1 fields to update: [start_date]
🔍 DEBUG - Checking row 300 | Pending map size: 1
🔍 DEBUG - Field start_date: pending=8, current=6, new=8
⏭️ Skipping start_date update - same value already pending
(2 seconds later)
🧹 Clearing pending: 300:start_date
```

#### Key Learnings

1. **Timing matters** - Cleanup operations must account for async state updates
2. **Refs persist across renders** - Perfect for tracking in-flight operations
3. **State updates are async** - React batches updates, causing delays
4. **Gantt events fire after reloads** - Must keep pending tracker populated during this window
5. **Atomic operations prevent race conditions** - Check-and-set must be one operation
6. **Debug logging is essential** - Without detailed logs, timing issues are invisible

#### Bug Hunter Detection

Bug Hunter successfully detected this issue:
```
🚨 Status: CRITICAL
⚠️  WARNING (Critical): Duplicate API calls for task 300 (20+ calls in 5 seconds)
⚠️  WARNING (High): Potential infinite loop detected
```

After fix:
```
✅ Status: HEALTHY
📊 API Calls by Task: ✅ Task 300: 1 call
```

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Duplicate API Calls

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple API calls for same task
- Infinite loop warnings in console
- Performance degradation

**Quick Fix:**
```javascript
// Check ALL locks before making API call
if (isSaving.current || isLoadingData.current || isDragging.current) {
  console.log('⏸️ Skipping API call - lock active')
  return
}

// Check pending tracker
const pendingKey = `${taskId}:${field}`
if (pendingUpdatesRef.current.has(pendingKey)) {
  return
}
```

**Diagnostic:** `window.printBugHunterReport()` → Look for "duplicate_api_calls" warnings

---

### Issue: Excessive Gantt Reloads

**Symptoms:**
- Screen flickering
- Slow performance
- UI lag during operations

**Quick Fix:**
```javascript
// Use skipReload option for drag operations
onUpdateTask(taskId, updates, { skipReload: true })

// Suppress renders during drag
suppressRender.current = true
```

**Diagnostic:** `window.printBugHunterReport()` → Check "ganttReloads" count (should be ≤ 3)

---

### Issue: Slow Drag Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Lag when dragging tasks
- Delayed visual feedback
- "Slow drag" warnings

**Quick Fix:**
```javascript
// Defer heavy operations until after drag
setTimeout(() => {
  performHeavyOperation()
}, 200)

// Add GPU acceleration CSS
style={{
  transform: 'translateZ(0)',
  willChange: 'transform',
  backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'
}}
```

## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Test 1: Simple Drag**
  - Drag a task with NO dependencies
  - Expected: 1 API call, 1 reload, no warnings
  - Run: `window.printBugHunterReport()`

- [ ] **Test 2: Drag with Dependencies**
  - Drag a task with 3+ successors
  - Expected: 1 API call, 1 cascade event, 1 reload, no warnings
  - Check console for cascade events

- [ ] **Test 3: Rapid Operations**
  - Perform 5 drag operations quickly
  - Expected: No duplicate calls, ≤ 3 reloads total, no critical warnings
  - Run: `window.printBugHunterReport()`

### Automated Testing

**E2E Tests:** [gantt-cascade.spec.js](../frontend/tests/e2e/gantt-cascade.spec.js)

```bash
cd /Users/rob/Projects/trapid/frontend
npm run test:e2e
