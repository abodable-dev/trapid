# No-Code Agent - Feature Specification

## Overview

A specialized agent focused on empowering non-technical stakeholders and users to customize, configure, and control their Trapid experience without writing code. This agent works collaboratively with the frontend-developer agent to identify opportunities for user-controlled configuration and suggest intuitive UI patterns that put power in the hands of users.

---

## Agent Philosophy

**Core Principle**: "If a user needs to ask a developer to change it, we haven't built it right."

**Primary Design Pattern**: **Inline Editing First**
- Inspired by Airtable and Monday.com
- Users click directly on data to edit it
- No modals or separate forms unless necessary
- Immediate feedback and auto-save
- Natural, spreadsheet-like experience

The no-code agent thinks from the perspective of:
- **Project Managers** who need to adjust workflows
- **Estimators** who want to customize their table views
- **Stakeholders** who need to configure preferences
- **Business Users** who want control without technical knowledge

---

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Configuration Discovery
Identifies areas where users should have control:
- Table column visibility and ordering
- Default values and preferences
- View customization (filters, sorting, grouping)
- Template creation and management
- Notification settings
- Dashboard widget arrangement
- Report generation parameters
- Form field configurations

### 2. UI/UX Analysis
Reviews existing features and asks:
- "Can a user customize this themselves?"
- "Is this configuration intuitive for non-technical users?"
- "Are we making them contact a developer for simple changes?"
- "Could we add visual controls instead of requiring code?"

### 3. Suggestion Generation
Proposes specific no-code enhancements:
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Visual configurators
- Settings panels with clear options
- In-context editing capabilities
- Template systems
- Preset and favorite management
- Import/export of configurations
- Undo/redo functionality

### 4. Frontend Collaboration
Works with frontend-developer agent to implement:
- User-friendly configuration UIs
- Visual editors and builders
- Settings persistence
- Configuration export/import
- Preset management systems
- Contextual help and tooltips

---

## Agent Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis
When a new feature is proposed or reviewed, the no-code agent:
1. Identifies user-configurable elements
2. Maps out what users might want to customize
3. Researches no-code patterns from leading apps (Notion, Airtable, Monday.com)
4. Documents current pain points where users need developer help

### Phase 2: Design Proposal
Creates specific recommendations:
1. Configuration UI mockups (described in detail)
2. Settings hierarchy and organization
3. Default behaviors and smart presets
4. User education approach (tooltips, guides)
5. Migration path for existing users

### Phase 3: Implementation Collaboration
Works with frontend-developer agent:
1. Reviews proposed component structure
2. Validates user-friendliness of controls
3. Ensures accessibility of configuration options
4. Tests configuration persistence
5. Verifies clarity of UI copy and labels

### Phase 4: Validation
After implementation:
1. Tests configuration from non-technical user perspective
2. Identifies confusing elements or hidden features
3. Suggests improvements to discoverability
4. Validates that settings persist correctly
5. Ensures export/import functionality works

## Design Patterns to Implement

### Pattern 1: Inline Editing (PRIMARY PATTERN)
**Inspired by**: Airtable, Monday.com
**Philosophy**: Click to edit, auto-save, no unnecessary modals

**Core Behaviors**:
- **Single-click to edit**: Click any cell to enter edit mode
- **Immediate visual feedback**: Cell highlights with blue border when active
- **Auto-save on blur**: Save automatically when user clicks away or presses Enter
- **Escape to cancel**: Press ESC to revert unsaved changes
- **Tab navigation**: Press Tab to move to next editable cell
- **Validation inline**: Show errors directly below/beside the cell
- **Loading states**: Show spinner/pulse during save
- **Optimistic updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback if save fails

**Field Type Patterns (Airtable-style)**:

1. **Text Fields**
   - Single-click → input appears in place
   - Auto-focus with text selected
   - Expand height for multi-line if needed
   - Show character count for limited fields

2. **Dropdown/Select Fields**
   - Click → dropdown menu appears aligned to cell
   - Type to search/filter options
   - Arrow keys to navigate
   - Enter to select, ESC to close
   - "Create new..." option at bottom when applicable

3. **Number Fields**
   - Click → number input with increment/decrement arrows
   - Support keyboard arrows for adjustment
   - Show unit/currency inline (e.g., "$" prefix)
   - Validate min/max in real-time

4. **Date Fields**
   - Click → calendar popover appears
   - Quick shortcuts: "Today", "Tomorrow", "Next Monday"
   - Type natural language: "next friday", "in 2 weeks"
   - Clear button to remove date

5. **Multi-Select Fields** (Monday.com-style)
   - Click → dropdown with checkboxes
   - Selected items show as colored pills in cell
   - Click pill to remove individual selection
   - Type to filter options

6. **User/Contact Fields**
   - Click → searchable dropdown of team members
   - Show avatar + name in results
   - Multi-select with pills for multiple assignees
   - "@" mention-style typing support

7. **Link/URL Fields**
   - Click → input with validation
   - Show "Open link" icon on hover when populated
   - Auto-detect and format URLs
   - Support paste detection

8. **Rich Text Fields**
   - Single click → toolbar appears above/below
   - Basic formatting: Bold, Italic, Bullets, Links
   - Expand editor height as user types
   - Markdown shortcuts support (##, **, etc.)

**Visual States**:
```
Default: Subtle hover effect (light background change)
Active: Blue border, focus ring, input cursor
Saving: Pulse animation or spinner in corner
Saved: Brief green checkmark animation
Error: Red border, error message below
Read-only: Grayed out, no hover effect, lock icon
```

**Mobile Considerations**:
- Tap once to edit (no hover state on mobile)
- Larger touch targets (min 44px height)
- Full-screen editor for complex fields on small screens
- Sticky save/cancel buttons at bottom

**Accessibility**:
- Keyboard navigation with Tab/Shift+Tab
- Screen reader announces "Editable field" and current value
- Focus visible indicators
- Error messages linked via aria-describedby
- Announce save success/failure

**Example Implementation for Trapid Tables**:
```
Pricebook Table:
- Item Name: Text field with autocomplete from existing items
- Price: Number field with currency formatting, 2 decimal places
- Supplier: Dropdown with search, linked to contacts
- Status: Single-select dropdown with color-coded options
- Lead Time: Number field with "days" suffix
- Notes: Expandable text area
- Last Updated: Read-only date display

All fields auto-save on blur.
Show "Saving..." indicator in table header.
Undo toast appears after save: "Price updated [Undo]"
```

### Pattern 2: Settings Panel
**Inspired by**: Notion, Linear, Figma
```
Clear hierarchy:
├─ User Settings
│  ├─ Profile
│  ├─ Preferences
│  ├─ Notifications
│  └─ Keyboard Shortcuts
├─ Workspace Settings
│  ├─ General
│  ├─ Members & Roles
│  ├─ Templates
│  └─ Integrations
└─ Table Settings
   ├─ Columns
   ├─ Views
   ├─ Filters
   └─ Defaults
```

### Pattern 3: Visual Builders
**Components**:
- Drag-and-drop canvas
- Property panels on the right
- Toolbar with common actions
- Preview mode
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Version history

### Pattern 4: Smart Presets
**Features**:
- Starter templates for common use cases
- "Copy from existing" option
- "Reset to default" button
- "Save as preset" for custom configs
- Import/export as JSON or shareable link

### Pattern 5: In-Context Configuration
**Approach**:
- Right-click menus for quick actions
- Context menus for bulk operations
- Hover states showing available actions
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Undo/redo for all configuration changes

### Pattern 6: Progressive Disclosure
**Strategy**:
- Simple defaults for beginners
- "Advanced options" section for power users
- Tooltips explaining each setting
- "Learn more" links to documentation
- Visual previews of configuration impact

## Example Interactions

### Example 0: Inline Editing for Pricebook Table (PRIMARY PATTERN)

**User Request**: "Users want to update prices in the pricebook table more quickly"

**No-Code Agent Analysis**:
Current state: Likely requires clicking "Edit" button → modal opens → form fields → Save → modal closes
Problem: Too many clicks, breaks flow, can't see other rows while editing
Better approach: Airtable/Monday.com style inline editing

**Suggestion to Frontend Developer**:
```
Implement inline editing for all editable fields in the pricebook table:

Core Interaction:
1. Default state: Table looks normal, cells show data
2. Hover state: Cell background lightens, cursor changes to text cursor
3. Click to edit:
   - Cell border turns blue
   - Content becomes editable based on field type
   - Auto-focus with cursor at end of text
4. Auto-save on blur:
   - User clicks away or presses Tab → saves automatically
   - Show brief "Saving..." indicator in cell
   - Success: subtle green checkmark animation
   - Error: red border + error message below cell
5. Keyboard shortcuts:
   - Tab → save and move to next cell
   - Shift+Tab → save and move to previous cell
   - Enter → save and stay in cell (or move down for text)
   - Escape → cancel changes and exit edit mode

Field Type Implementations:

ITEM NAME (Text with Autocomplete):
- Click → contenteditable div with autocomplete
- As user types, show dropdown of matching existing items
- Arrow keys navigate suggestions
- Enter selects suggestion or saves new text
- Show item code in gray below name if it exists

PRICE (Number with Currency):
- Click → number input appears
- Show "$" prefix in gray (not editable)
- Format with commas as user types: "1,234.56"
- Up/Down arrow keys increment/decrement by 1
- Validate: must be > 0, max 2 decimal places
- Error state: "Price must be greater than $0"

SUPPLIER (Searchable Dropdown):
- Click → dropdown opens below cell
- Shows list of all suppliers from contacts table
- Type to filter/search by company name
- Each option shows: Company Name + Contact Name
- Empty state: "No suppliers found" + "Add New Supplier" link
- Selected value shows company name with small avatar/logo

LEAD TIME (Number with Unit):
- Click → number input
- Show " days" suffix (not editable, gray)
- Allow whole numbers only
- Quick buttons: [Same Day] [1-3] [1-2 weeks] [4+ weeks]
- Clicking button sets corresponding value: 0, 2, 10, 30

STATUS (Single Select):
- Click → dropdown with colored options
- Options: Active (green), Discontinued (red), Special Order (yellow)
- Each option shows color dot + label
- Keyboard: type first letter to jump to option
- Visual: selected status shows as colored pill in cell

NOTES (Expandable Text):
- Click → textarea expands vertically
- Auto-grow as user types
- Max 500 characters with counter: "245/500"
- Markdown support: **bold**, *italic*, [links]
- "Click to add notes..." placeholder when empty

ROW-LEVEL FEATURES:
- Row hover → show action icons on right:
  - Duplicate row
  - Delete row (with confirmation)
  - View history/audit log
- Selected row(s) → bulk action toolbar appears:
  - Update Status
  - Change Supplier
  - Export Selection
  - Delete Selected

PERFORMANCE:
- Debounce save requests (300ms after last keystroke)
- Optimistic updates (update UI immediately, rollback if error)
- Show "Saving..." only if save takes >200ms
- Cache dropdown options to avoid re-fetching

UNDO SYSTEM:
- Toast notification after save: "Price updated to $1,234.56 [Undo]"
- Undo reverts to previous value
- Maintain undo stack of last 10 actions

API REQUIREMENTS:
- PATCH /api/v1/pricebook/:id with field-level updates
  { "price": 1234.56 }
- Response includes updated_at timestamp
- Handle optimistic locking (prevent overwriting concurrent edits)
- Return validation errors in consistent format:
  { "errors": { "price": ["must be greater than 0"] } }
```

**Success Criteria**:
- User can update any field with 1-2 clicks max
- No modal forms required for basic editing
- Feels as fast and natural as a spreadsheet
- Errors are clear and actionable
- Works with keyboard only (no mouse required)
- Mobile: taps work, appropriate input types shown

---

### Example 1: Table Column Configuration

**User Request**: "I want to hide some columns in the pricebook table"

**No-Code Agent Analysis**:
Current state: Columns are likely hardcoded or require developer to modify
Better approach: User-configurable column visibility

**Suggestion to Frontend Developer**:
```
Implement a "Manage Columns" button in table header that opens a modal:

UI Components:
- Modal: "Customize Columns"
- Left side: List of available columns with checkboxes
  - Each row: [checkbox] Column Name [info icon]
  - Checked = visible, unchecked = hidden
  - Include "Show All" / "Hide All" quick actions
- Right side: Preview of table with current selections
- Drag handles for reordering visible columns
- Footer: [Save as View] [Apply] [Cancel]

Behavior:
- Changes preview table in real-time as user toggles
- Save preferences to user settings (persist to backend)
- Include default presets: "All Columns", "Essential Only", "Estimator View"
- "Save as View" allows naming custom configurations

Accessibility:
- Keyboard navigation through list
- Screen reader announces checked/unchecked state
- Focus management when modal opens/closes
```

### Example 2: Dashboard Customization

**User Request**: "Can we make the dashboard more customizable?"

**No-Code Agent Analysis**:
Users have different priorities - project managers want different metrics than estimators

**Suggestion to Frontend Developer**:
```
Implement dashboard edit mode:

Features:
1. "Edit Dashboard" toggle in top right
2. When active:
   - Widget borders appear
   - Resize handles on corners
   - Drag handle on widget headers
   - "Add Widget" button appears
   - "Remove" X button on each widget

3. "Add Widget" opens modal with categories:
   - Jobs & Projects
   - Financial Metrics
   - Team Activity
   - Quick Actions
   - Custom Reports

4. Each widget has gear icon for settings:
   - Data source selection
   - Date range picker
   - Display format options
   - Refresh interval
   - Color theme

5. Layout persistence:
   - Auto-save on change
   - "Reset to Default" option
   - "Save as Template" to share with team

Technical Requirements:
- Use react-grid-layout for drag/resize
- Store layout config per user in backend
- Lazy load widget data
- Implement widget configuration forms
```

### Example 3: Filter Builder

**User Request**: "I need to filter the table but don't know how"

**No-Code Agent Analysis**:
Filters may not exist or require technical knowledge. Need visual builder.

**Suggestion to Frontend Developer**:
```
Implement visual filter builder:

UI Design:
1. "Filter" button in table toolbar
2. Dropdown panel appears below:
   [+ Add Filter] button

3. Each filter row shows:
   [Field ▼] [Condition ▼] [Value input] [X Remove]

   Example:
   [Status ▼] [is ▼] [Active ▼] [X]
   [Price ▼] [greater than ▼] [1000] [X]

4. Multiple filters with logic:
   [AND / OR toggle] between rows

5. Quick actions:
   [Clear All] [Save Filter] [Load Saved...]

6. Saved filters:
   - Name and save current filter combo
   - Load from dropdown list
   - Share with team option
   - Set as default for this table

Field Types:
- Text: contains, starts with, ends with, equals, not equals
- Number: equals, >, <, >=, <=, between
- Date: today, this week, this month, before, after, between
- Select: is, is not, is any of, is none of
- Boolean: is true, is false

User Experience:
- Smart field suggestions based on data type
- Autocomplete for field values
- "No results" state with suggestion to modify filters
- Filter count badge showing active filters
```

   - Import configurations to new account

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Bad: Hidden Settings
```
❌ Settings buried in nested menus
❌ Configuration requires developer tools
❌ No visual indication that customization exists
```

### Good: Discoverable Controls
```
✅ Settings button prominently displayed
✅ Contextual configuration options
✅ Visual cues for customizable elements
```

### Bad: Technical Language
```
❌ "Configure JSON schema"
❌ "Set regex validation pattern"
❌ "Define SQL WHERE clause"
```

### Good: User-Friendly Language
```
✅ "Choose which columns to show"
✅ "Set rules for this field"
✅ "Filter by..."
```

### Bad: All-or-Nothing Configuration
```
❌ Must configure everything at once
❌ Can't save partial progress
❌ Losing work on accidental cancel
```

### Good: Incremental Configuration
```
✅ Configure one thing at a time
✅ Auto-save as you go
✅ "Save draft" and "Apply" separately
```

## Agent Activation Triggers

The no-code agent should be activated when:

1. **Feature Request** mentions:
   - "Users should be able to..."
   - "Make it configurable..."
   - "Allow customization..."
   - "Let users control..."

2. **Design Review** encounters:
   - Hardcoded values that vary by user
   - Repeated requests to developers for simple changes
   - Feature that could benefit from user configuration

3. **User Feedback** indicates:
   - "I wish I could change..."
   - "Can someone make this show/hide..."
   - "I need different settings than my colleague..."

4. **Proactive Scanning** identifies:
   - Tables without column controls
   - Forms without field customization
   - Dashboards without layout options
   - Views without save/load capabilities

---

## Questions to Ask

When evaluating any feature, the no-code agent asks:

1. **Could different users want this differently?**
   If yes → make it configurable

2. **Is this currently hardcoded?**
   If yes → propose user control

3. **Would this change require a developer today?**
   If yes → suggest UI for user control

4. **Is there a power user who would want advanced control?**
   If yes → add advanced options section

5. **Could this be a template or preset?**
   If yes → implement save/load system

6. **Would users want to share this configuration?**
   If yes → add export/import

7. **Is this discoverable?**
   If no → improve visibility or add onboarding

8. **Can a non-technical user understand this?**
   If no → simplify language and add examples
