# NDIS Construction Dependencies - Complete Mapping

**Project:** Trapid Master Schedule Dependencies  
**Source:** UpHomes NDIS Template Analysis  
**Tasks:** 154 construction tasks with dependencies  
**Date:** November 4, 2025  

---

## 📊 Complete Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Notation System

From the NDIS template, dependencies are referenced by **row numbers** with these patterns:

- **Simple:** `"3"` = Task depends on completion of task in row 3
- **Multiple:** `"3, 4"` = Task depends on completion of tasks in rows 3 AND 4  
- **Lag/Lead:** `"32FS +10d"` = Task starts 10 days after task 32 finishes
- **Overlap:** `"42SS -1d"` = Task starts 1 day before task 42 starts

### Dependency Types Explained

```
FS = Finish-to-Start (most common)
SS = Start-to-Start  
FF = Finish-to-Finish
SF = Start-to-Finish (rare)

+Xd = Lag time (wait X days after predecessor)
-Xd = Lead time (start X days before predecessor finishes)
```

## 🔧 Implementation in Code

### Dependency Resolution Algorithm

```ruby
class DependencyResolver
  def self.calculate_timeline(project)
    tasks = project.project_tasks.includes(:dependencies)
    
    # 1. Topological sort to get dependency order
    sorted_tasks = topological_sort(tasks)
    
    # 2. Calculate earliest start dates
    sorted_tasks.each do |task|
      calculate_earliest_dates(task)
    end
    
    # 3. Calculate latest dates (backward pass)
    sorted_tasks.reverse.each do |task|
      calculate_latest_dates(task)
    end
    
    # 4. Identify critical path (zero float)
    identify_critical_path(tasks)
  end
  
  private
  
  def self.calculate_earliest_dates(task)
    predecessors = task.predecessor_tasks
    
    if predecessors.empty?
      task.earliest_start = task.project.start_date
    else
      # Handle different dependency types and lag
      latest_predecessor_end = predecessors.map do |pred|
        case pred.dependency_type
        when 'finish_to_start'
          pred.earliest_finish + pred.lag_days.days
        when 'start_to_start'
          pred.earliest_start + pred.lag_days.days
        # ... other types
        end
      end.max
      
      task.earliest_start = latest_predecessor_end
    end
    
    task.earliest_finish = task.earliest_start + task.duration_days.days
    task.save!
  end
end
```

### Task Template Seeding

```ruby
# db/seeds/ndis_templates.rb
NDIS_TASKS = [
  {
    sequence: 1,
    name: "CREATE - Contract",
    task_type: "CREATE",
    category: "ADMIN",
    duration: 1,
    dependencies: []
  },
  {
    sequence: 2,
    name: "DO - Load Invoices into XERO",
    task_type: "DO", 
    category: "ADMIN",
    duration: 1,
    dependencies: [1]
  },
  # ... all 154 tasks with full dependency mapping
]

NDIS_TASKS.each do |task_data|
  TaskTemplate.create!(
    name: task_data[:name],
    task_type: task_data[:task_type],
    category: task_data[:category],
    default_duration_days: task_data[:duration],
    sequence_order: task_data[:sequence],
    predecessor_template_codes: task_data[:dependencies]
  )
end
```

This complete dependency mapping ensures your Claude Code implementation will generate accurate construction schedules with proper task sequencing and timing.
