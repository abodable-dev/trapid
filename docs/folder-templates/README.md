# OneDrive Folder Templates

This directory contains folder structure templates for automated OneDrive folder creation when new jobs are created in Trapid.

## Purpose

When a new construction job is created in Trapid, the system can automatically create a standardized folder structure in OneDrive based on these templates. This ensures consistency across projects and reduces manual setup time.

## Template Format

Templates are stored as JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "template_name": "Template Name",
  "template_type": "residential|commercial|renovation",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "root_folder_pattern": "{job_code} - {project_name}",
  "folders": [
    {
      "name": "Folder Name",
      "level": 1,
      "order": 1,
      "description": "Optional description",
      "children": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Available Variables

The following variables can be used in `root_folder_pattern` and folder names:

- `{job_code}` - Unique job identifier (e.g., "RES-2024-042")
- `{project_name}` - Project title (e.g., "Smith Residence")
- `{client_name}` - Client full name
- `{address}` - Job site address
- `{start_date}` - Project start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `{project_manager}` - Project manager name

## Creating New Templates

To create a new template:

1. Copy an existing template JSON file
2. Rename it appropriately (e.g., `company-name-template-type.json`)
3. Update the metadata:
   - `template_name`
   - `template_type`
   - `description`
   - `created_by`
4. Modify the folder structure as needed
5. Ensure `level` and `order` values are correct
6. Update the total folder count in metadata
7. Document the template in this README

## Implementation

These templates will be used to:

1. **Seed default templates** in the database when OneDrive sync feature is deployed
2. **Allow users to create custom templates** by duplicating and modifying these
3. **Automatically create folders** when new jobs are created in Trapid
4. **Maintain consistency** across projects within an organization

## Database Migration

When implementing, use this structure to seed the `folder_templates` and `folder_template_items` tables:

```ruby
FolderTemplate.create!(
  name: "Tekna Standard Residential",
  template_type: "residential",
  is_system_default: true,
  folder_template_items_attributes: [
    # ... generated from JSON
  ]
)
```

## Future Templates

Additional templates to consider:

- **Commercial Build** - Multi-unit and commercial construction
- **Renovation Projects** - Home renovation workflow
- **Luxury Residential** - High-end custom homes
- **Multi-Unit Development** - Apartments and townhouses

## Maintenance

- Templates should be reviewed quarterly
- Update templates based on user feedback and regulatory changes
- Version templates when making significant changes
- Keep deprecated templates for historical job reference
