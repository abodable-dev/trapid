## User Flow

```
1. User opens Active Job detail page
   ↓
2. Clicks "Schedule Master" tab
   ↓
3. Sees empty state with file upload area
   ↓
4. Drags/uploads Excel file (e.g., UpHomes NDIS Template.xlsx)
   ↓
5. System imports 154 tasks → Success toast
   ↓
6. Stats show: 0 of 154 matched (0%)
   Task list displays all 154 tasks with "Match" buttons
   ↓
7. User clicks "Match" on first task
   ↓
8. Modal opens showing:
   - Suggested POs (filtered by supplier category)
   - All other POs
   - Search bar
   ↓
9. User selects a PO and clicks "Confirm Match"
   ↓
10. Task updates to show green "PO #XXX" badge
    Stats update: 1 of 154 matched (1%)
    ↓
11. User continues matching more tasks...
    ↓
12. Once matched_count > 0:
    → Gantt chart section appears below task list
    → Shows timeline of matched tasks
    → Can switch between Day/Week/Month views
    → Click tasks to see details
```

## Known Considerations

### CSS Import Workaround
- frappe-gantt CSS is inlined in ScheduleGanttChart.jsx
- This avoids Vite build issues with package exports
- All original styles preserved with dark mode enhancements

### Performance
- Task list uses DataTable with built-in sorting
- No pagination yet (assuming <1000 tasks)
- Gantt chart performance good up to ~200 tasks
- For larger datasets, consider virtualization

### Future Enhancements
1. **Critical Path Highlighting**: Identify and highlight critical path in Gantt
2. **Bulk Matching**: Select multiple tasks and match to same PO
3. **Auto-matching**: Smart suggestions based on historical data
4. **Task Dependencies Editor**: UI to add/edit predecessors
5. **Export Schedule**: Download matched schedule as PDF/Excel
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket updates for multi-user collaboration
7. **Resource Allocation**: Add team member assignments to tasks
8. **Calendar View**: Alternative view to Gantt chart
9. **Milestone Tracking**: Special task type for milestones
10. **Progress Photos**: Attach photos to tasks for progress tracking

vercel --prod  # Deploy to production
```

### Backend
- No backend changes required
- All APIs are already implemented and deployed

### Environment Variables

## Support & Documentation

- **Component Docs**: `/frontend/src/components/schedule-master/README.md`
- **Knowledge Base**: `/Users/jakebaird/trapid/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- **Backend Docs**: Check backend API documentation for endpoint details

## Summary

The Schedule Master tab is now fully implemented and integrated into the Active Job detail page. All 6 components work together to provide a complete workflow from import to visualization. The implementation follows Trapid's design patterns, supports dark mode, and is mobile-responsive.

The frontend is ready for testing. Once the user tests the workflow with real data, any adjustments can be made based on feedback. The backend APIs are already in place, so this is a frontend-only deployment.

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy frontend to Vercel
2. Test with sample schedule file (UpHomes NDIS Template.xlsx)
3. Verify all workflows work end-to-end
4. Gather user feedback for future enhancements
