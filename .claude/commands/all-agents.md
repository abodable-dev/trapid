# Run All Agents

Launch all 6 specialized agents in parallel to perform health checks and status reports:

1. **backend-developer** - Check backend health
2. **frontend-developer** - Check frontend health
3. **production-bug-hunter** - Scan for production issues
4. **deploy-manager** - Check deployment status
5. **planning-collaborator** - Review current roadmap
6. **gantt-bug-hunter** - Run Gantt Bible compliance checks

Read each agent's `.md` file from `.claude/agents/` and launch them in parallel using the Task tool.
