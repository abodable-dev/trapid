# Claude Code Agents

This directory contains specialized agent definitions for the Trapid project.

## Agent Attribution

Agent definitions support an `author` field in YAML frontmatter to track who created each agent:

```yaml
---
name: My Agent
description: What it does
model: sonnet
author: Jake  # Matches user by name or email
---
```

The sync task uses this priority for attribution:
1. Explicit `author:` field in frontmatter (recommended)
2. Git history (first commit author)
3. Fallback to current user

## How to Use

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Run single agent
"run backend-developer"
"run frontend-developer"
"run production-bug-hunter"
"run deploy-manager"
"run planning-collaborator"
"run gantt-bug-hunter"
"run trinity-sync-validator"

```

### Run All Agents

```bash
"run all agents"
"/ag"
"allagent"
```

This will run all 13 agents in parallel with health check tasks.

## Database Integration

All agent definitions are automatically synced to the `agent_definitions` database table.

### Viewing Agents in UI

Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/admin/system?tab=developer-tools** → "Agent Status" sub-tab

The UI displays:
- Agent name and icon
- Description and focus area
- Last run timestamp
- Total runs and success rate
- Current status (success/failure)
- Run button to execute agent

### Auto-Sync Mechanisms

Agents are automatically synced to the database in two ways:

**1. Git Post-Commit Hook (Automatic)**
- Whenever you commit changes to `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- The hook detects changed agent files
- Automatically runs `bin/rails trapid:agents:sync`
- Agents appear in UI immediately after commit

**2. Manual Sync Command**
```bash
# From project root
npm run sync-agents

# Or directly
cd backend && bin/rails trapid:agents:sync
```

## Run History

Agent run history is tracked in the **database** (`agent_definitions` table):

- `total_runs` - Total number of times agent was executed
- `successful_runs` - Number of successful executions
- `failed_runs` - Number of failed executions
- `last_run_at` - Timestamp of last execution
- `last_status` - Last run status (success/failure)
- `last_message` - Last run message/summary
- `last_run_details` - JSON details of last run

View run history in the UI at: **http://localhost:5173/admin/system?tab=developer-tools** → "Agent Status"

## Agent Definitions

Each agent has a Markdown file defining:
- Purpose and capabilities
- When to use
- Tools available
- Success criteria
- Example invocations

## Updating Agents

To modify an agent:
1. Edit the corresponding `.md` file
2. Agent changes take effect immediately
3. No restart required

## Adding New Agents

### Step 1: Define the Deliverable FIRST (Before Writing Any Code)

**Critical:** Agree on what the agent will OUTPUT before creating the file. This prevents scope creep and ensures clear success criteria.

Answer these questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| **What is the agent's job?** | One sentence description |
| **What does it check/do?** | List of specific checks or actions |
| **What does it output?** | Exact format (see example below) |
| **What triggers it?** | Manual, proactive, on PR, scheduled? |
| **What tools does it need?** | Read, Grep, Glob, API calls, Edit, Write? |
| **What's the token budget?** | Estimated tokens per run |
| **Pass/Fail criteria?** | What makes each check pass or fail? |

### Step 2: Design the Output Format

Create a mockup of EXACTLY what the agent should produce. This becomes the contract.

**Example: Gold STD Table - SSoT Agent Output**

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Trinity Entries:       21 types documented       [PASS]  ║
║  Gold Standard Cols:    21 column types           [PASS]  ║
║  Type Comparison:       21/21 matched             [PASS]  ║
║  SQL Type Sync:         22/22 defined             [PASS]  ║
║    (+1 action_buttons system-only)                        ║
║  Column Validation:     21/21 have rules          [PASS]  ║
║  Code Audit:            No unauthorized dupes     [PASS]  ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  System Columns:        id, created_at, updated_at        ║
║  Single Source of Truth: Trinity T19.xxx                  ║
║  Bible Rule: #19.37                                       ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  Est. Tokens:           ~5,600                            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Why this matters:**
- Clear visual confirmation of pass/fail status
- User knows exactly what to expect
- Agent has clear success criteria to implement
- Token budget is transparent

### Step 3: Create the Agent File

Create `.claude/agents/your-agent-name.md` with this structure:

**IMPORTANT:** The description MUST use the standard box format shown below. This displays in the Agent Status UI popup.

```markdown
---
name: Your Agent Name
description: |
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  Check 1:               Expected result            [PASS] ║
  ║  Check 2:               Expected result            [PASS] ║
  ║  Check 3:               Expected result            [PASS] ║
  ║  Check 4:               Expected result            [PASS] ║
  ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
  ║  Focus: One line description of agent purpose            ║
  ║  Bible Rule: #X.XX (if applicable)                       ║
  ╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
  ║  Est. Tokens:           ~X,XXX                           ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
model: sonnet  # or opus, haiku
color: blue    # optional: blue, green, red, yellow, orange, cyan, gray
type: diagnostic  # or development, deployment, planning
author: Jake  # Your name - matches database user by name or email
---

## Notes

- Agents are stateless (each run is independent)
- Run history is stored in the database and persists across sessions
- Agent definitions (markdown files) are version-controlled
- Agent run statistics are tracked automatically in the database
- Agents should fetch from Trinity API (`/api/v1/trinity`), never read markdown files
- Trinity database is the source of truth for all documentation

## Recording Agent Runs

When an agent completes, record the run via API. Pass your git user name to track who ran it:

**Via curl (from CLI/hooks):**
```bash
# Get git user name
GIT_NAME=$(git config user.name)

# Record success
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/agent_definitions/your-agent-name/record_run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Task completed\", \"user_name\": \"$GIT_NAME\"}"

# Record failure
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/agent_definitions/your-agent-name/record_run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"status\": \"failure\", \"message\": \"Error occurred\", \"user_name\": \"$GIT_NAME\"}"
```

**Via Rails console:**
```ruby
# Success with user name
agent = AgentDefinition.find_by(agent_id: 'your-agent-name')
agent.record_success('Task completed', { details: 'metadata' }, user_name: 'RobertJHarder')

# Failure
agent.record_failure('Error message', { error: 'details' }, user_name: 'RobertJHarder')
```

This updates:
- `total_runs` (incremented)
- `successful_runs` or `failed_runs` (incremented)
- `last_run_at` (current timestamp)
- `last_status` ('success' or 'failure')
- `last_message` (your message)
- `last_run_details` (optional metadata)
- `last_run_by_name` (git user name)
