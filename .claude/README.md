# Claude Code Setup for Trapid

This folder contains configuration for Claude Code, the AI pair programmer used on this project.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered development assistant that helps with:
- Writing code (frontend & backend)
- Reviewing code and finding bugs
- Deploying to production
- Planning features
- Answering questions about the codebase

## Quick Setup

### 1. Install Claude Code

Follow the instructions at: https://docs.claude.com/docs/claude-code

### 2. Configure Your Machine

The project is already configured in this `.claude/` folder, but you need to allow file access for your user:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Clone the repo first
cd /path/to/trapid

# Claude Code will use the settings.json in this folder automatically
# No additional setup needed!
```

**Optional: Add user-specific permissions**

If you want Claude Code to access files outside this repo, create `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(//Users/YOUR_USERNAME/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

## Project Documentation

Read these files to understand how Claude Code works with Trapid:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Main instructions for Claude Code
- `docs/FRONTEND_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` - Design system and template usage
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development workflow

## Important Notes

### Deployments

- **Backend:** Deploys to Heroku via `git subtree push`
- **Frontend:** Auto-deploys via GitHub Actions when you push to `main`
- **You don't need Vercel access** - GitHub Actions handles it

### What Gets Deployed

When you merge to `main`:
1. GitHub Actions automatically deploys frontend to https://trapid.vercel.app
2. For backend changes, Claude Code will deploy to Heroku
3. Migrations run automatically

### Permissions

The `settings.json` file gives Claude Code permission to:
- Run git commands
- Deploy to Heroku/Vercel
- Run Rails commands
- Install npm packages
- Read/write files in this project

These permissions are **project-wide** and safe for all team members.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code can't access files

Make sure you're running Claude Code from the project root:
```bash
cd /path/to/trapid
claude
```

### Deployments failing

Check that you have:
- Heroku CLI installed and logged in: `heroku auth:whoami`
- GitHub access configured: `gh auth status`

### Need more help?

Ask Claude Code:
```
How do I set up my development environment?
```
